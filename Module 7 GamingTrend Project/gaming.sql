From the beginning the company’s goal was to find the best and the brightest people in the game industry and to build a truly great game with exceptional graphics and superior gaming experience.&nbsp; The first key position sought by the company was an industry leader, an expert in game development and particularly someone with MMO expertise.&nbsp; The company’s search successfully attracted a true industry legend, Joe Ybarra, who joined the Cheyenne team in July 2005.&nbsp; Joe quickly saw the possibilities for a Stargate MMO and realized the opportunity to build a truly world-class development studio.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Joe’s game development experience on board the next key position to be filled was for a business leader who could organize the administrative functions of the company so that Joe could focus on building world-class entertainment products. In August of 2005 the company asked that I join the Cheyenne team to give Joe the support he needed not only to make Stargate Worlds a great success but to position us to become a premier entertainment company.&nbsp; Our first public announcement was on January 31, 2006, and was the culmination of the work that had been in (inaudible) creation for nearly four years.&nbsp; Now in full swing, Cheyenne has a growing staff of top industry veterans and is poised to deliver well beyond the dream begun by the three original creators.&nbsp; Cheyenne is now rapidly becoming the leading developer of interactive entertainer software products.&nbsp; The company is dedicated to creating cutting edge unique entertainment.&nbsp; The company expects to develop highly recognizable brands with high quality technology, distinctive artwork and rich game play.&nbsp; Cheyenne continues to recruit top industry talent to ensure its success as a game development company.&nbsp; The company’s overall strategy is to be a premier global entertainment company.&nbsp; Our focus is on the creation, development, publishing and distribution of quality interactive products.&nbsp; Our success will be measured by high levels of customer satisfaction and retention, broad-based appeal and shareholder returns.&nbsp; Our business strategy really has three distinct components.&nbsp; First, the design of the highest quality products.&nbsp; Second, generate global appeal and strong brands.&nbsp; Third, achieve high customer satisfaction and retention.&nbsp; Fourth, recruit and develop the industry’s most capable entertainment professionals.&nbsp; Five, produce exceptional economic returns.&nbsp; Last but not least, to grow rapidly through continued strategy acquisitions and alliances.&nbsp; While I could easily talk about our evolving strategy for hours, you can read much more about it by visiting our web site. For now I think your time will be best served by focusing our discussion on our Stargate Worlds’ project.&nbsp; We have built a very strong relationship with MGM and will be coordinating our activities closely with them and their production team in Vancouver to make sure that SG1, Atlantis and Stargate Worlds are all closely tied together in storyline, themes and characters.&nbsp; To discuss our Stargate Worlds game in more detail I would like to turn some time over now to Joe Ybarra, our Vice President of Product Development. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Thank you and good morning ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; As Tim has just indicated I am responsible for the creation of Stargate Worlds along with the rest of our team.&nbsp; This morning I would like to share with you a few of the high level thoughts that we have about our product and perhaps a little bit of detail here in some of the areas that we are pioneering. One of the things I will begin this conversation by saying is the fact that we are currently still in preproduction of our product.&nbsp; Part of our strategy as far as the preproduction cycle is concerned is to try to get some of our customers involved, which is the reason why we have launched our forum site already a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; Very shortly we will be launching the community site for Stargate Worlds.&nbsp; We plan on continuously updating the community site and the forums with information about our product, as we evolve the details of the design, and as we are able to share more and more information about what our plans are. So with that context and that caveat, I will describe a little bit about the Stargate Worlds’ game.&nbsp; I think we will begin by talking about, what are the elements about Stargate that are particularly attractive from an MMO perspective?&nbsp; I think the most obvious one is the concept of the Stargate itself.&nbsp; The Stargate, as we know from the TV series, provides us with a vehicle that allows us to basically transport our players anywhere in the universe.&nbsp; By anywhere, we mean any obvious planet surface, in outer space, inside interiors of space craft or ancient ruins or various other locations.&nbsp; It is a perfect vehicle for us to be able to transport people and it gives them a sense of awe and exploration. Another component that is very compelling about it is the fact that it is contemporary.&nbsp; The events that take place in this show could take place tomorrow.&nbsp; Because of that, we can identify with the characters and the people who are represented in the Stargate material itself.&nbsp; Players can identify with a Jack O’Neill or Samantha Carter or with any of the other characters that we see in the TV series.&nbsp; Of course we won’t necessarily be using those particular people, but the fact is that people can identify with them and it makes it easy for us to work with the personas and player characters. Another aspect of it, of course is like all good science fiction, we have plenty of great aliens, a rich back story of history given that we have over nine seasons of material to work with so there is plenty of good, historical information that gives depth to the races as well as give us an (inaudible) to the races so we have plenty of opportunities for creating conflict and interesting interactions between the different species that are in the game. Then I think one of the big things that we really want to focus on is how lighthearted the actual tone of the storytelling is.&nbsp; The fact is that the show doesn’t take itself that seriously and we think that is a really compelling aspect of why the Stargate has been so popular for so long.&nbsp; It is very easy to identify with the characters when they are joking about their circumstances.&nbsp; We want to make sure we retain that type of atmosphere in our game as well. So with that in mind, given that we had such a great bulk of material to work with, there are three major areas that I will speak about in this conversation.&nbsp; They are more about the environment.&nbsp; I want to talk about the combat system to a certain degree and then I want to talk about guilds and organizations that the players will be creating as they play our product. Starting off with the game environment, as I mentioned earlier because we have the opportunity to transport people anywhere in the universe, we plan on taking great advantage of that.&nbsp; This implies of course that there will be a fair degree of use of instances in our game.&nbsp; By the same token, there will also be very large scale wide open play environments that people will be able to play in.&nbsp; We need a lot of real estate to make this game come to life, as far as play surface area.&nbsp; One of the components that we are really focusing in on heavily in this game is to find areas of play for the users that are not directly combat related.&nbsp; So because we will need a lot of playfield area in which to enact that, this is an area that we are focusing a lot of attention on.&nbsp; At the same time we also really want to capture the feel of science fiction, so we do plan on having quite a bit of content that is related to alien civilization both extinct as well as current.&nbsp; We also are excited about the idea of having entire playfields take place inside a spacecraft.&nbsp; For those of you that have been following the show, you are aware of the fact that there are various races including the humans that have large-scale…big spaceships, and they are perfect opportunities for us to create large environments for users to travel in, much like Dungeons in a fantasy role-playing type product.&nbsp; We also want to put you in various interesting other places.&nbsp; For example we are very keen on trying to put people on the surface of the moon or some other vacuum oriented airless environment.&nbsp; The implication of that of course is that you would need survival equipment and various other things in order to survive in those environments.&nbsp; Of course the fact that we already discussed here that we have spacecraft, implies that there will be space travel in this game.&nbsp; We do plan on supporting the idea of the users having spacecraft at some level and we want to be able to capture that.&nbsp; One of my philosophies is that you cannot have a science fiction game without whooshing spaceships so ….we will have whooshing spaceships.&nbsp; Some other really crazy ideas that we talked about, if we actually enact, is actually having scenarios that take place on the surface of a star or we put people inside or near a black hole or various other things.&nbsp; But again, what we are trying to capture here is the atmosphere and the feel of grand science fiction and the ability to transport instantaneously anywhere in the universe. To accomplish all this, like any good MMO, we need to have various different player character types and races.&nbsp; One of the things again that we fall back to from the Stargate material directly, is the fact that we have player archetypes that are very obvious and readily identifiable.&nbsp; So beginning with the fact that the FG1 team is an Air Force entity immediately can look at the (inaudible) design around the idea of squads and the military organization that the Air Force and other military branches represents.&nbsp; So we will be using that as sort of the contact for how players will group and how they will form alliances between each other.&nbsp; So kind of view it as this is sort of the Air Force is exploring the universe at the same time that we recognize that because there is conflict in this as in any product, that we will be building things around the squad base system, which I will get into more details in a moment.&nbsp; So within that, of course, we have lots of alien races and different types of possibilities, for what players might be represented by.&nbsp; The most obvious of course is the Jaffa, (inaudible) as one of the game characters in SG1.&nbsp; It is not a human so we would expect that the players would be able to play Jaffa and various other non-human races.&nbsp; They are still investigating the possibility of which kinds of races we would like the users to be represented by.&nbsp; We have some pretty interesting ideas in that area, so stay tuned as we get more details out on that.&nbsp; Again, we will be concentrating on making sure we have lots of different races.&nbsp; The player archetypes themselves though are so much different in Stargate Worlds.&nbsp; For instance, we have a scientist in the form of Samantha Carter, who is also an Air Force person.&nbsp; She can fly jet aircraft.&nbsp; She is an astrophysicist.&nbsp; So as a player archetype, we want to be able to demonstrate a couple of things.&nbsp; One is the scientist player, the engineering type player, as well as the alien technology reverse engineer type player, and various other different things that are somewhat unique and different from what you would typically see in an MMO.&nbsp; So this is sort of the class and skill access of our player reorientation.&nbsp; Within that context, this is a good moment for me to describe one of our other philosophies about the design of Stargate Worlds, which is non-combat game playing.&nbsp; We feel that in order to appeal to the widest audience possible, that in addition to having a very robust combat system, we want to have an environment in which the users can do things that are not combat and have a very rich and compelling game experience.&nbsp; So to that extent we are designing a very elaborate construction system for allowing players to construct different housing, different activities on planet side. For instance one of the things that we have discussed is the idea of constructing an (inaudible) mine so that you have a mining facility and refinery that allows the users to process the raw ore and turn it into something that is usable as a commodity.&nbsp; That is just one example of constructions. We also would like to have pillboxes, fortifications and various other things as well as things like planetary shields, the ability to defend yourself against orbital bombardments and various other things.&nbsp; Again, all of this material coming directly from the TV series is just construction. We also have the opportunity to have an elaborate tech tree.&nbsp; And the tech tree gets into the idea that we have several advanced alien races such as the Asgard. They have a very rich and detailed technology base that we can allow users to explore and, if you will, level up in their skills and the knowledge base about that type of technology.&nbsp; Besides the Asgard there are several others as well, so we have a rich opportunity here from a player growth standpoint to pursue technology.&nbsp; Crafting of course is in any of these games.&nbsp; It is the biggest component of it.&nbsp; Again, we can rely on the alien technologies as well as just the basic raw materials on the planets in order to have a very rich and robust crafting system.&nbsp; Lastly, trading.&nbsp; We think it is really important that we support the free economy, if you will, and allow players to trade freely between each other between planets as well as smuggle when we try to move contraband from say the Goa’uld technology base into the Asgard’s technology base.&nbsp; We have a lot of different play activities that are not combat related. Having said that, I will speak about combat now because combat is going to be the biggest percentage of play activity, as is in any MMO.&nbsp; But within this context our plans are to do squad-based combat as I mentioned earlier. The typical TV show has four people stepping through the Stargate and engaging in some type of activity on planet side, some of which is directly combat related.&nbsp; In our game design we will be supporting four player squads.&nbsp; For solo players, if it turns out that you cannot find or you don’t wish to fight with a whole bunch of other people then we will provide you with AI-driven mots that will support you in various different missions and activities. Combat in our game is going to be very modern, as it is in the TV series, so the users will be equipped with P90 machine guns as well as shot guns, as well as other types of modern equipment including explosives like hand grenades and C4 explosives and what-not.&nbsp; So the obvious implication of this, is that combat is quite brutal in this game.&nbsp; One of our philosophies is that unlike some of the other products it is not possible for you to stand up and tank next to a person with a 50 caliber machine gun.&nbsp; To that extent we want to take advantage of our play fields and our environments and encourage the players to use commanding control to basically scout ahead and advise the other teammates about what to do.&nbsp; We also are putting a high premium on stealth, using the terrain and other things for cover so that users are not going to be exposed to machine gun fire or other things.&nbsp; So you want to be smart if you traverse the playfield where you are in a combat-intensive environment. We also will have various different electronic counter measures and ways of looking at the playfield.&nbsp; That is a specialty perhaps that the scientist or the engineer type…where they actually have the ability to spot enemies and be able to target them and perhaps call in indirect fire through mortars or artillery barrages.&nbsp; So the idea is again to reinforce the idea we have squad-based combat, we have modern infantry combat tactics that we are modeling in this game.&nbsp; We are taking advantage of the playfield with respect to cover and stealth and we will have lots of different other types of player environments that support the combat (inaudible)…combat.&nbsp; So we think that this is going to be pretty exciting, and there will be lots of opportunities here for us to do some pioneering work in the whole genre of MMO, as we try to really enact this modern combat system. The last thing I would like to talk about is, about our structures for social aspects of the game.&nbsp; MMOs are really about communities of people and because they are about communities of people we feel that one of the areas that we could do some innovative work is to really try to make the guild systems and the squad systems and all of the hierarchies in-between a very compelling play experience for the user.&nbsp; So to that extent our plans are to try to work with guild leaders and other people who do these things on an ongoing basis to find out what kind of tools they need to help organize their guilds.&nbsp; We also plan on having play activities that are related specifically to guilds.&nbsp; One of the big (inaudible) concepts that we have been discussing has been a guild leveling system.&nbsp; The guild itself actually generates through the course of its members various points or the equivalent of experience points so the guild itself is progressing.&nbsp; As a result of the guild progressing, it will unlock construction capabilities, expansion capabilities, technological abilities as well as the obvious economic benefits. The other thing that the guild will be able to do is bestow rank upon the player.&nbsp; So as the player joins the guild and begins as a private he can progress through the guild hierarchy and become a general.&nbsp; Within the context of that, we will have various play mechanics that will support that activity.&nbsp; The fact that you are a general will give you more capabilities with respect to commanding, control and accessing guild resources than if you were say a private. So all of this is try to encourage what we think is an important thing, which is server competition.&nbsp; As all MMOs, we don’t expect the entire population of our game will be on one server, so we will have (inaudible) to our environment or individual server environment.&nbsp; One other play in the activities that we would like to work with is to have server competitions where technological levels are achieved on an individual server.&nbsp; They can be compared against other servers.&nbsp; There are various other things.&nbsp; I am just focusing on technology as an example but there are many other criteria that we can use to expand and encourage competition at that level of play.&nbsp; So there are a lot of interesting things that we want to do with respect to the community stuff.&nbsp; Once again as we evolve the details from all of this material we will make this available on the community site and to various members of the press and other people attending this call on an individual basis as well. So with that I guess I will open it for questions.&nbsp; I am all done.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Tim Jenson:&nbsp;Operator, if you could open it up for questions? </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Yes, thank you.&nbsp; We will now begin the question and answer session.&nbsp; If you have a question, please press star then ”1” on your touchtone phone.&nbsp; If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash (#) key.&nbsp; If you are using a speakerphone you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers.&nbsp; Once again, if there any questions press star then “1” on your touchtone phone.&nbsp; John Callaham from Gamecloud is online with a question.&nbsp; Please go ahead.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Hi guys.&nbsp; Thanks for this press conference.&nbsp; It is pretty cool games that you guys are launching.&nbsp; I do have a couple of questions.&nbsp; You said that this is currently in preproduction?&nbsp; Does that mean that the graphics engine for this game has not been selected yet? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We are going to make an announcement sometime very soon about where we are going with technology.&nbsp; But the answer is that we are actually pretty far along on the client side engine to the extent that one of the deliverables for the close of preproduction is our first playable prototype. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Is this a game engine that you guys have developed?&nbsp; Or are you licensing something else? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We will make an announcement about that later. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;The other question I had was that a lot of other MMOs have been based on licensed properties such as Star Wars’ galaxies and the Matrix online have not perhaps lived up to the promise that they originally had.&nbsp; Are the folks at the development team aware of this?&nbsp; What kinds of things are they trying to do to make this game appealing to both the fans of this TV show as well as MMO types who…obviously this market has grown tremendously in the past few years and there are a lot of them out there. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Well, I think the first thing to say is that regardless of whether we have a property or not we have to build a really exciting and compelling game.&nbsp; All of us on the development team are not only just avid hardcore gamers and especially MMO game players but most of us are very experienced at building this type of product.&nbsp; So our primary focus is for us to make a really terrific game.&nbsp; Then on top of that we can extract from the Stargate material itself -- all the really good stuff that I have already described plus a bunch of stuff I didn’t describe.&nbsp; It really enforces and enhances the experience of being in the Stargate universe.&nbsp; So it is sort of in that order of importance.&nbsp; We have to build a great game and then we build a great game that uses and takes advantage as much as we can of the Stargate material.&nbsp; To further answer your question the other thing that is really terrific about this property is that MGM and Bridge Productions, the folks that actually make the show in Vancouver, are really excited and cooperative in working with us on this property.&nbsp; Bridge has already supplied us with a tremendous amount of material from the TV series including many of the digital assets that they use for the special effects on the show itself.&nbsp; That material can actually be directly imported into our game. So we will have some authentic material in the game design as a whole that come from the show. Most important of all is the fact that the folks in Vancouver really want to have a good relationship with what we are doing.&nbsp; One of the goals that we have in this product is to intertwine the material that you see on the TV series as it is being released together with updates during the live team with the game so that the game and the TV set show are in lockstep with one another with respect to the storytelling and the content. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Is it possible that we could see a crossover maybe event in the game itself?&nbsp; Maybe referred to in the TV show and vice versa?</P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;That is one of our goals.&nbsp; Clearly one of the issues with that is the flexibility of the coordination of all activity given the fact that they have to make the show and then it has to be scheduled to be aired and it has to be timed perfectly with the release of an update.&nbsp; So it is going to be a challenge for us to be able to do that, but it is our goal to try to accomplish that. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;All right.&nbsp; Thank you very much. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Sure. </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Our next question comes from Mike Thies from WOOT Radio.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>Mike Thies:&nbsp;Hi, thanks.&nbsp; Guys, I have to say I have a lot of people that are really excited about the concept of this game and one of the questions that I have gotten from some of our listeners is, is there going to be a developing storyline?&nbsp; As in are we going to see the missions changing?&nbsp; Some missions not being available as updates come out? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Well, whether or not we deny content in terms of taking missions away…we haven’t discussed that, but we certainly do intend on enhancing the product and moving the storylines forward as we go to a live team aspect of the game.&nbsp; One of the things that is interesting about building an MMO is that you have to have a very robust and powerful tool library.&nbsp; Part of that is for us to be able to do live team content update.&nbsp; So to that extent because we are staffing our organization with really good writers and people who really understand the medium of what it is like to translate television into storytelling and quests.&nbsp; But yes we do plan on expanding new story lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be releasing Atlantis as an expansion kit and when that comes out clearly we will start a new thread. </P>\r\n<P>Mike Thies:&nbsp;The other thing that a lot of folks are concerned about in a lot of games especially for MMOs anymore is character customization.&nbsp; If you are going to play a human, and obviously you are going to end up being part of the military, you are going to end up in a uniform, which means there are not a lot of options there for your character to be truly unique and represent yourself, which is something that games like City of Heroes and City of Villains have really set the standard for as far as making someone stand out in a crowd.&nbsp; How are you going to accomplish something similar? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Wow!&nbsp; That is a tough question to answer because we are in the middle of deciding exactly how we want to enact that as we speak.&nbsp; But a short answer to your question is the fact that in addition to the standard military material…and your observation is correct.&nbsp; The show is dominated by humans so one of the goals that we have here is to try to create original set of races that the players can play so that there is diversity from that standpoint.&nbsp; But when you look at the actual…what am I wearing?&nbsp; And what is my persona in the game?&nbsp; We certainly have other things to draw from than just Air Force uniforms.&nbsp; In particular what we look at is how we mix technology into that.&nbsp; As you go further up the ranks here in terms of levels you will have access to equipment such as space suits and various other kinds of use that will allow the user to look very different.&nbsp; When we start pioneering things like (inaudible)…that is usable as equipment and armor and various other things.&nbsp; We can have a very distinctive look to the game. Another aspect of it is that the show has made a turn in that area as well by introducing characters that are not Air Force.&nbsp; So we will have a fair amount of flexibility here with how we, if you will, clothe our customers and make them look unique because we understand how important that really is. </P>\r\n<P>Mike Thies:&nbsp;And will you be focusing on things like facial features as well to make them extremely in-depth in body shape and size? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We are still making those decisions as we speak.&nbsp; The cost to do that from a performance standpoint is fairly steep.&nbsp; We have to be judicious about how we do that.&nbsp; But we certainly want to give the user as much customizable capability as we possible can given the constraints we have to work in. </P>\r\n<P>Mike Thies:&nbsp;Okay, I just have a couple more things here.&nbsp; One is, are we going to see the signature characters from the series making appearances in the game at some point?&nbsp; Or are you going to try and separate yourself to a point from that? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We don’t really know the answer to that question at this time.&nbsp; A lot of this is still being decided because number one of course not everybody can be Jack O’Neill so certainly we are going to be focusing on the game design as being independent of the stars of the show.&nbsp; However, whether they have participation in our product or not- we have not yet determined that. </P>\r\n<P>Mike Thies:&nbsp;Okay, the only other thing I wanted to talk about was, you are talking about using partial cover and things like that.&nbsp; Does that mean the environment is going to be destructible in long-range goal? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Not in the fullest extent.&nbsp; There will be certain areas of the playfield that will likely be destructible but to make the entire playfield malleable and destructible is right now not something we are contemplating. </P>\r\n<P>Mike Thies:&nbsp;Okay, thanks.&nbsp; That’s all I have for now. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Sure. </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Our next question comes from Bart Fiddler from GamerGod.com.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>Bart Fiddler:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; I appreciate the opportunity to join the conference here.&nbsp; You guys have a great concept going.&nbsp; It is an exciting time.&nbsp; One of the main things that I had a question about was, you mentioned instances and the incredible exploration potentials that are associated with the Stargate itself.&nbsp; The question that I have is the worlds that we travel through from the Stargate, are these all going to be static, pre-generated worlds?&nbsp; Or will there be any potential for unique exploration in that we may be able to step through the Stargate and see sort of a random generated content? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We actually haven’t discussed dynamic content of that type.&nbsp; One of the things we understand very well is how important the actual playfield design is.&nbsp; With respect to being able to do something that is artistically pretty stunning together with from a play standpoint is really pretty exciting and unique.&nbsp; Things that we have constructed by hand.&nbsp; So we really haven’t really looked at the random environment generation capability, which is not to say that we won’t do it it is just that we haven’t looked at it yet. </P>\r\n<P>Bart Fiddler:&nbsp;Okay, thank you.&nbsp; The next question I have is you put a lot of emphasis on the brutal nature of the combat in that we will be using terrains, etc.&nbsp; Is this then based on more of a twitch-based combat?&nbsp; Almost a first-person shooter?&nbsp; Or will there be more of the overstyle MMO skills-based combat? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We are looking at this as more being the skill-based type of combat system.&nbsp; We actually have a posting on our forum that talks to this point.&nbsp; But basically the idea is that if we try to do something that is very twitch-based in a very traditional MMO environment, we don’t have any real control over the number of users that are in a particular area and obviously we have no control whatsoever over the bandwidth and the system specifications of the end user.&nbsp; So if we try to do something that is very twitch-based in a very open environment like this we run the risk of some customers being penalized just because they have a bad connection or some other issue that we have no way of being able to work with. To that extent we want to stay with the traditional type of MMO.&nbsp; It is a hidden turn-based environment. When I said hidden and turn-based of course if you look at any modern game we will use World of Warcraft…as an example, although that game design is not a twitch-based environment the combat pacing is so fast that it just seems like it is real time.&nbsp; Our game will play very much like that. </P>\r\n<P>Bart Fiddler:&nbsp;Fantastic.&nbsp; Now as far as PVP combat there has been some talk about there being contested worlds.&nbsp; Does that imply that there is going to be some shape (inaudible) within the game?&nbsp; Or is it going to be an open PVP type of environment?&nbsp; Along those lines you mentioned in solo play we are going to have the advantage of potentially using AI bots.&nbsp; Will there be any ability to use the AI bots in PVP combat? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Well, let us see.&nbsp; Two questions there so I will talk about contested worlds first.&nbsp; Our concept of this is if you look at the way the game architecture works at the strategic level there are three major areas of play.&nbsp; The first one being of course the newbie experience and its immediate follow-on, which is, “I am still learning the world but I have a handle on it”.&nbsp; The second is the midgame experience and the mid-game is basically the leveling treadmill to get up into the elder game play and of course the elder game play is the third level. What we are expecting to do for contested world is to make that an elder game play feature, whereby the time the customer and the guilds have pioneered their way up to these high level of play, that they will have capabilities in terms of being able to construct spacecraft, planetary defenses and various other kinds of things.&nbsp; So it will be a very large scale capability for the player and a very rich play environment.&nbsp; We want to put them in a PVP environment in doing that so the contested worlds are essentially open playfields that are rich with lots of material in them in terms of both resources such as (inaudible) and various other resources that will allow users to use as well as enemies and various other things including specialized quests that are just for the contested world.&nbsp; The ideas that we want to put the various factions against one another in vying for these environments. There is a PVE type of component as well using the exact same paradigm.&nbsp; So we plan on doing that as well but this is again targeted for the elder game play.&nbsp; In terms of the bought usage though in PVP, I think a lot of that will fall on a play test.&nbsp; It depends entirely on the atmosphere that we want to see the users in.&nbsp; You know if you look at the way some of the traditional MMO’s handle large-scale raids, it is not unreasonable for us to imagine a situation where there are two guilds that are competing against each other that have several hundred players together all fighting over a playfield or an environment that they are contesting to get the resources off of.&nbsp; So in a situation like that to throw bots into that circumstance might muddy the waters more than would be helpful. Whereas on the other side of the coin if you were say in a straight PVE circumstance in a contested world and there are only say 40 or 50 people in your guild who may need to be able to supplement that with bots.&nbsp; We don’t know that yet and we will determine that as we go through play test. </P>\r\n<P>Bart Fiddler:&nbsp;Okay, thank you.&nbsp; Another question I had was if the entire server full of players is going to be using the same Cheyenne Mountain complex to being their debentures that seems to pose some serious issues as far as available game space and congestion.&nbsp; How are you going to handle an entire server of people using the same Stargate? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We will not all be starting from the same location.&nbsp; One of the big things is that of course there is the alpha site that is the dominant in various different episodes of the TV series.&nbsp; But we are going to spawn also other starting locations for the users to overcome the issue that you just described.&nbsp; Cheyenne Mountain will actually just be one of the locations that you can actually go to and visit but it is not what we consider to be home base, if you will. </P>\r\n<P>Bart Fiddler:&nbsp;So not to monopolize too much of the time I do have one more question about character customization.&nbsp; I know you discussed that you guys are still in the process of defining that.&nbsp; But what considerations have been put in for the very cool custom sunglasses that everybody on SG1 team uses? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;(Laughing) I guess I am going to have to wait until the Art Department comes back with their feelings on sunglasses.&nbsp; We like sunglasses too, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we had them. </P>\r\n<P>Bart Fiddler:&nbsp;Great.&nbsp; Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;No problem.&nbsp; Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; Our next question comes from Laura Griffin from Stargategame.com.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Hello.&nbsp; I just want to get a few simple ones out of the way.&nbsp; A couple of them have already been answered.&nbsp; Anyway I want to say congratulations guys on getting your game started.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;One of the questions we had on our site was, are you going to have any of the main actors like Michael Shanks, Christopher Judge, and Amanda Tapping in the game? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We don’t know the answer to that yet. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Are there going to be any flyable vehicles?&nbsp; Or are you going to be completely stuck on the ground? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;It is hard to design those to be able to support not only space travel but also that we might actually have death gliders and various other forms of flyable equipment.&nbsp; The problem we are going to have…there are several technical issues associated with us supporting that but this is certainly one of our goals here is to have that capability.&nbsp; If nothing else, even if the users cannot fly them we will definitely have them in there as basically things that are buzzing around and shooting at you.&nbsp; So it is very likely though that we will allow the users to actually have this equipment. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Another one is the character races.&nbsp; I don’t know…I came in five minutes late so I don’t know if you had mentioned them or not.&nbsp; Are you guys going to have like the goal the race Asgard?</P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We will represent all of the races in the game.&nbsp; I think one of the questions that we are still struggling to finalize is which ones are the players able to play but we will make sure that we get them all in there though. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;What season are you guys going to be setting up in?&nbsp; Season 9? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We don’t know the answer to that yet because when we launch our product it will be after the Season 10 material has already been aired.&nbsp; So much of the material that we will be using to stay contemporary with the TV series has not yet been designed by the TV show folks.&nbsp; So we will be working very closely with them to make sure that our product is contemporary with the work that they are doing on the series itself.&nbsp; So I guess this is a way of getting you a non answer.&nbsp; We don’t know the answer to that question yet but it will be determined in conjunction with the folks in Vancouver. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; When I came on also I heard you say you had hired some writers.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Is there any way you can give us some idea of who they are? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Yes, we will talk more to that on the community site when we launch the community site. But certainly yes, we will give access to the appropriate people at our team here as time unfolds. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;I just have a couple more.&nbsp; I guess you really probably cannot answer this because you are still in pre-production, but are you going to be part of SG1 or the Atlantis in the game?&nbsp; Or is it going to be more generic? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;It is going to be more generic but this is a tricky question because we want to start the user’s new experience.&nbsp; When you first start to play we want to give you a good, solid grounding in something you are comfortable and familiar with.&nbsp; For example let us say you start off as an SG team member.&nbsp; Whether you stay as an SG team member is something that we are going to allow the user to actually do themselves.&nbsp; Of course we are just talking about SG.&nbsp; There are several other different types of squad-based environments that we are going to be looking at including the Goa’uld themselves are going to be creating SG type teams of their own.&nbsp; So the answer is kind of a tricky one to give you. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Now a couple of hard ones real quick.&nbsp; I don’t know if…I am from the community from the Stargate Alliance game that was just cancelled.&nbsp; I am one of the forum admins over there.&nbsp; I was curious to a couple of community questions for you real quick.&nbsp; I was wondering how the impact of the game being cancelled has affected any of your strategy towards your news (inaudible)…your interaction with MGM…anything like that? <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;No, it has no effect whatsoever. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Okay, so your timing…you did not have any plans changed when they announced the downfall of alliance? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;No, that was actually completely independent of the work that we are doing.&nbsp; A lot of what we have been trying to accomplish here is, that before we could have a discussion like this one, that we had to be a certain percentage of the way down the road here as far as the work is concerned and the evolution of our company.&nbsp; So that probably dictated our timetable more than anything else did. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Here is one that you probably want to get out there.&nbsp; A lot of people feel that way in the (inaudible) reliance.&nbsp; You guys have no involvement with the cancellation of (inaudible) allowance? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;That is correct. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;I just had one in my head too.&nbsp; Sorry, I have a cold.&nbsp; Community interaction -- one of the things that personally the Stargate Alliance community group did as a failing is they did not have a lot of interaction with Web sites with the community and with the fans throughout their early production through late production.&nbsp; I am wondering if you guys are going to address the problems they had or if you are going to be really active with your guys’ forums and all the community sites? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Well, to that extent and Sara Baker, our Director of Marketing can address this question even better than I can, but one of the philosophies that we based our company around was the idea that when you build an MMO you are building a service and not a product.&nbsp; Part of being in the service business is that you have to interact with your customers and essentially try to give them what they want in every case that is feasible. So part of being an MMO is really not only acknowledging the existence of the community but being part of it and working with the community and actually actively soliciting their feedback, making them feel like they are part of the processes and involved with what we are doing because certainly once we launch and they are playing our product they will be doing that as they are experiencing the game.&nbsp; So to that end we hired our community manager, Katie Postma (we jokingly refer to her as Earth Mother for a Million People) several months ago in preparation for getting ready to launch the community.&nbsp; Once we have the community site up and running we do plan on supporting all the fans as much as we possibly can.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Do you guys have an about timetable of when you are going to be looking to release the games?&nbsp; Are we talking two or three years down the road? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Yes, we have a timetable and we are not really at liberty to discuss that just yet.&nbsp; But we will certainly make announcements about that as it becomes appropriate. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;I am going to kill everybody with this last one.&nbsp; At the end of the question and answer is there any way to get any screen shots of concept parts after this briefing? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;I imagine there is. (Laughing) </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;You imagine there is?&nbsp; Okay!</P>\r\n<P>Sara Baker:&nbsp;There is some concept on our corporate site and we will be launching the full community site on March 1, in which case there will be updates every week.&nbsp; If you have any specific requests, you can e-mail them to me and I will do the best that I can to get you whatever you need. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; I am going to turn it over to somebody else for some questions and I will ask more later. </P>\r\n<P>Sara Baker:&nbsp;Okay, thanks. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Okay, thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; Once again if there are any questions please press star then “1” on your touchtone phone.&nbsp; John Callaham from Gamecloud is online with a question.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Hello again.&nbsp; I did not realize it was going to be that quick. You said there was no time release date for the game.&nbsp; Is there going to be anything shown at the game perhaps at E3 this May? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Not at this particular E3, no.&nbsp; Our thinking is that we will probably show something following E3, which would be 3 of 2007. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Are you guys searching for a publisher for a game?&nbsp; Or are you guys going to be handling that yourselves? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Yes, we are in the process now of talking and exploring possibilities for publication.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Is it possible this game will be…is this game targeted as a retail product?&nbsp; Or are you guys going to be doing a download only product? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;That actually would be more of a decision that we will make in concert with our publisher. </P>\r\n<P>John Callaham:&nbsp;Okay, guys.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;No problem.&nbsp; Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Our next question comes from Laura Griffin from Stargate.com.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Same thing as him.&nbsp; I did not know if was going to be over that fast.&nbsp; I am curious if you guys said you are not sure about Michael Shanks, Christopher Judge and all them.&nbsp; If you guys are able to bring them into the game are you going to be bringing any of the elder characters like Braytag Jenis* anybody like that in? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Again, we don’t know.&nbsp; There is so much material to work with right now that we are still trying to get 80% of the product designed and built.&nbsp; So the addition of the stars and various other specific actors of this is something we haven’t really gotten into yet. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Have you guys…I am pretty sure we have already figured out that it is going to be a monthly cost for the game.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Well, we are thinking that but again that is a function of what our publisher decides so we are remaining flexible until we have our publishing partners selected and we will work directly with them as to what the best economic model for the product will be. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; You guys are going to be (inaudible) for Atlantis, SG1 and all that.&nbsp; Are they going to be interacting with each other? Or is it going to be like totally on two different servers, those kind of things where the worlds are a little bit separated? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We don’t really know the answer to that but going in position is they should be together.&nbsp; We like the idea of integrating the Atlantis material directly with the SG1 material but again we don’t know the answer to that just yet.&nbsp; But like I say our current thinking is to integrate them. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;About the SGC are you guys…do you have plans to fully (inaudible) SGC where they can have like full (inaudible) capability where they have like all…what is it?&nbsp; Is it 40-something levels?&nbsp; Or 20-something levels? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;I am sorry.&nbsp; I don’t quite understand the question. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;The SGC -- Stargate Command Cheyenne Mountain. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Cheyenne Mountain, right. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Are you guys planning on like (inaudible) and everything else are you guys planning on building the whole thing? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We haven’t quite figured that one out yet either.&nbsp; We discussed using Cheyenne Mountain as sort of a play environment as opposed to say a home base.&nbsp; So whether we decide to model that in any type of robust and extended version or not we haven’t decided that yet. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;We had another question.&nbsp; Will any new enemies be introduced?&nbsp; I am assuming that is up to the writers and everything else for the next season. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Boy, that is a good question because this steps into a couple of different domains here.&nbsp; In working with the folks at Vancouver at Bridge Productions we know that it is their desire that they will introduce new enemies.&nbsp; Of course bearing in mind the fact that there are between now and when we are on the marketplace and you can play our game there is going to be at least one full season that is yet to be written.&nbsp; It is kind of hard for me to comment on exactly what direction the folks up there are willing to go with that.&nbsp; With respect to the game itself, however, we do know that in order for us to have a varied and rich play environment that we will probably end up inventing some new alien types.&nbsp; One of the things that we enjoy about our relationship with MGM and Bridge is the fact that they are willing to let us do that.&nbsp; But of course we want to make sure we do this in a fashion that is very sympathetic with what the TV series is doing.&nbsp; So this is a very vague answer to your question because we really don’t know.&nbsp; We know we need some new ones but what they are and when they will be and how they relate to the show, we don’t know. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;I have another question.&nbsp; For the time I have been with Stargate the Alliance Website I understood they had locked down the license or the rights to make a Stargate game.&nbsp; How did you guys get the capability to come around and do the (inaudible)?&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;That actually is a fairly straightforward question.&nbsp; Essentially the MGM property management team looked at the property of Stargate IV the interactive entertainment media as two different types of product.&nbsp; The alliance product was geared towards the stand-alone retail marketplace so they were preparing a product that would not be online basically.&nbsp; So what our team had been doing, and as Tim had mentioned at the beginning of this call, several years ago our original founders had started negotiating with MGM and I cannot comment because I don’t know what relationship that negotiation had relative to the Stargate alliance product but they were very independent of one another.&nbsp; The perception all along is the MMO or the online game is a different product than the retail product and that is how MGM has chosen to approach that.&nbsp; So within the context of what we are doing, we have the exclusive worldwide rights to the online version of Stargate and all of the Stargate material, which includes SG1 and Atlantis.&nbsp; Because of that we will be building products that address that particular marketplace, which means that whatever is decided on the stand-alone retail product is not part of what we are discussing here. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Basically dancing on the line here.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Yes. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Well, congratulations to you guys.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;The other one is I am sure the guys working for you (inaudible) so I am like this one.&nbsp; I just want to make sure because I was involved with the alliance guys a lot and make sure you take care of your team, the guys working for you.&nbsp; Keep them happy and let them make a good game. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Absolutely.&nbsp; We will definitely do that. </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;If I can think of anything else I will buzz back in. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Laura Griffin:&nbsp;Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Operator:&nbsp;Our next question comes from Craig Dalrymple from GamerGod.com.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; I am very excited about the opportunity to be here and actually hear more about the game.&nbsp; I am looking forward to it.&nbsp; I would like to ask more questions about the non-combat classes, the scientists, diplomats, engineers and combat.&nbsp; Are they being designed such that they will have a place in combat? You kind of mentioned that they might be able to call in mortar attacks or whatnot in combat.&nbsp; Or will the core of abilities…basically will there be a separate place (inaudible) for people who just want to deal with crafting and that is what line they enjoy?&nbsp; Or will they need to go out and do the combat and level up to get more abilities that way? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;One of the things we have actively discussed now from the beginning of preproduction is whether it will be possible for a player to play the game all the way to a maximum level cap without ever engaging in combat whatsoever.&nbsp; So we are certainly make a serious effort to see if we can create play activities and an enjoyable game experience in which that would be possible.&nbsp; That being said, we also know that if you look at the TV show that Michael Shanks, Daniel Jackson has a gun and he uses it from time to time but that is not his role in the show.&nbsp; So we would certainly expect the players would be able to assume that type of a role and responsibility in their game play.&nbsp; But the real point I want to make here is that we are really emphasizing non-combat game play here because we recognize that many of our customers and potential customers that may not want to spend a lot of their time doing combat and do enjoy the idea of exploration and crafting, construction, engineering and all kinds of other things.&nbsp; So we really want to make sure that play experience is very rich and varied for those people. </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; I have a question about the diplomat (inaudible) or arts type.&nbsp; I don’t remember seeing this before in an online game.&nbsp; Is the intent behind that someone who is going to interact with MPC factions for perhaps your guild?&nbsp; Or will they serve as a liaison between live factions and other players?&nbsp; What’s the idea there? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We expect that they will do both.&nbsp; There is an underpinning to our design and our technology that is hard for me to describe this without getting into the details.&nbsp; But the idea is that there are MPC groups that are out there that can be influenced and various different…how can I explain myself here.&nbsp; It is possible that you could negotiate with say a village or a town on a planet and using your diplomat to get favors from that particular entity.&nbsp; This is one of the major things we want to use that particular class of player character for.&nbsp; Again, without getting into details it is really hard for me to describe exactly how that would work but this is an area that we have also invested a fair amount of time on. </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;On your trading system and free economy that people can participate in, is this to the point where traders will be able to work with say engineers and build that mine and refine that material and actually load it up on the ship, pilot it to another part of the galaxy or go through a gate to another area in the universe and trade it off for the optimal pricing?&nbsp; Is it going to be like that where the players really get to play a live market?&nbsp; Or is it intended to be played (inaudible)…</P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;I think we are going to have both.&nbsp; The player to player is going to be the big one because of the nature of the way we are designing the technology tree and the crafting construction system.&nbsp; The ability to build high-level unique things is going to be very interesting because it will be hard for everybody to be really good at everything so we will expect (inaudible) will specialize in particular things say for example they will be really good at Asgard technology and will be able to create materials that are specific to that tech tree.&nbsp; But on the other side of the coin, you already described a play mechanic that we also support, which is the idea of free trade between MPC worlds, if you will. So we will want to make sure we have that too. </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Cool.&nbsp; On your website about the game you refer to Shader Model 3.0’s ability to function with (inaudible) machines.&nbsp; Since you know a bit about the game engine you are going to use, do you know already your benchmark for the bottom (Inaudible) the cutoff for computers? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Not really yet because we really won’t know that until we can test under load.&nbsp; It is more than just (inaudible) technology it is also how it performs in the client server environment.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Here’s a real zinger I found searching around the Net.&nbsp; What everybody else had to say about the game.&nbsp; I found the screen shot actually hosted on Team X-Box.com.&nbsp; I haven’t seen anything else indicating it might come out on the 360.&nbsp; Do they have it (inaudible) like that?&nbsp; Is that your actual design intent? (Inaudible) platform?</P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Could you repeat the question please? </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;In researching and searching out what people have already discovered about the game I found that the Website teamX-box.com has information on Stargate Worlds up as a 360 release in the future. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;No kidding?&nbsp; I didn’t know that. </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; So that would be a surprise to you guys then?&nbsp; And that’s not (inaudible)</P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Oh, I have to go and check that out.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;I can send you the link if you’d like. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Oh, I’d love that.&nbsp; Yes, if you would I would appreciate it.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Certainly.&nbsp; Then I will go back to combat.&nbsp; A lot of the (inaudible) options you have already indicated that it is going to be character ability skills based so it won’t be like an SPS*.&nbsp; How will using…you know you described a very interesting mix of tactics using (inaudible) and everything else.&nbsp; If I am hiding behind a tree will that cause object collision?&nbsp; Or is that going to be a plan that will modify just a lot of chances of me being hit? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;There are actually about two or three other things that it will affect as well. This is the area of the design that we have invested a fair amount of effort on to the extent that we have actually started…we have a couple of prototypes that we have already built that allow us to understand how cover works with in particular AI and how it affects movement and various other components.&nbsp; So I guess there are two things that I am addressing.&nbsp; One is that hiding behind a tree…the tree does provide hard cover.&nbsp; But the other side of it is that it also provides a modifier of a two hit number as well as perhaps the damage done.&nbsp; We are picking on a tree because there are things like (inaudible) and shields and other things.&nbsp; So the properties and the characteristics of how cover works in this game is very dynamic to the point where we have to have several different variables in order to model that correctly.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Last question for (inaudible) combat would be you already intend to support vehicles.&nbsp; Will there be vehicle involvement in combat?&nbsp; Or would they merely be a motor transport? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;We don’t know the answer to that question yet because part of the issue with supporting vehicles as combat things is that we have to start modeling (inaudible) physics in the vehicle simulation.&nbsp; That is where we are in our pioneering work on the tech base right now for the game as a whole.&nbsp; We know we want to do it.&nbsp; The question is how robust can we make it. </P>\r\n<P>Craig Dalrymple:&nbsp;Very good.&nbsp; That would be awesome.&nbsp; (Inaudible)…&nbsp; thank you very much.&nbsp; I appreciate the time to ask the questions.&nbsp; I am looking forward to your game. </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Thank you. </P>\r\n<P>Operator: &nbsp;Our next question comes from Jaina Mistry from SG1atlantis.com.&nbsp; Please go ahead. </P>\r\n<P>Jaina Mistry:&nbsp;Hi.&nbsp; I have a couple of questions from over the pond actually.&nbsp; I was wondering if there is going to be a beta version available for this obviously very, very far in the future at the moment.&nbsp; Will there be? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Absolutely. </P>\r\n<P>Jaina Mistry:&nbsp;Who will be able to test this out?&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Well, we will do the normal procedure of having a close beta and we will start gathering names for people that will want to be part of that process probably right after we launch the community site.&nbsp; Then at some point during the beta cycle here we will have the traditional open beta where we will allow anybody to come in and play the game and of course this will all be a part of the stability as well as the content material that we will be putting into the game so you can look forward to this being a very normal or standard industry practice here in terms of our beta cycle. </P>\r\n<P>Jaina Mistry:&nbsp;Also, about the guild…will there be any interactivity between guilds say forming alliances between the guild themselves instead of just players and characters in the game? </P>\r\n<P>Joe Ybarra:&nbsp;Absolutely.&nbsp; We really want to encourage that big time because we believe that in order for some of the play activities to take place in this game that the guilds may have to get really big in terms of greater than 500 people playing in the guild.&nbsp; That is part of our design architecture for the guild’s progression system here is that for example if you want to build a Goa\'uld mother ship that the amount of resources and manpower required to do something like ','<P>Conference Call with Cheyenne Software, Developers of Stargate Worlds</P>','2006-02-22','27','1','2005','e3preview','','','','','','','','','','');
insert into `Articles` values('153','Xbox 360 Roundup','<P>{image1:left}The Xbox 360 had a large presence at last year’s E3, but Microsoft needed to make a large impression this year with the announcements of the PS3 and Wii trying to steal the thunder.  I checked out the games coming out for the Xbox 360 this year, including some of the major titles.  Here are some of my impressions.</P>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<hr />\r\n<P><STRONG><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=4723\">Madden NFL 07</a> – Be the First Domino</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Madden NFL 07 brings the same engine from last year’s version.  However, that doesn’t mean that they aren’t adding any new features.  This year you get to be the first domino.  With this feature in place, instead of being the guy with the ball, you get to be the lead-off blocker.  You get to be the one Madden comments “BOOM” about.  Putting a hit on a guy to let your runner get through is a nice feeling.</P>\r\n<P>{image2:right}Kicking is handled with the analog sticks in this version instead of the traditional button press.  The left analog stick aims the kickoff, but the right analog stick controls power and accuracy.  I wasn’t prepared for this, so my initial kickoff wasn’t pretty.  However, it is similar to most golf games, so it should feel natural within a few practice times.</P>\r\n<P>The build didn’t include Madden announcing they plays.  Instead a local announcer was again doing the play-by-play.  The announcer is more audible this time though, but it still doesn’t sound as fluid as the old ESPN series.</P>\r\n<P>Hopefully this year’s version will include Training Camp and Franchise Mode.  You know, the things that should have been in last year’s version.\r\n<br/ ><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/screenshots/index.php?GameID=4723\"><strong>>>Screenshots</strong></a></P>\r\n<br/ >\r\n<P>{image3:right}<STRONG><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=4197\">Too Human</a> – Is that a Bad Thing?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Too Human is one of the games touted as one of the major exclusives for the Xbox 360.  The graphics do look great for it with spectacular lighting effects.  These were only two levels available for playing, so it’s hard to tell how varied the environments are going to be.  These two levels looked to be quite different from each other, which is hopefully a good indicator for the rest of the game.</P>\r\n<P>The control scheme is something that fans of Advent Rising should take note of.  The left analog stick controls movement, but the right stick controls which enemy you lock on to.  This is a great way to lock onto an enemy, even from far distances.  The only bad thing is that sometimes it seemed like you’d see the same animations over and over again, and you’d have to wait for the animation to finish before performing the next movie.</P>\r\n<P>A bar fills up with every enemy that you kill.  Once this bar fills, a super move is available that can dispatch several enemies at one time.  This isn’t unlike something you’d see from Dynasty Warriors.</P>\r\n<P>Enemies do seem to want to rush you head on and even walk into your attack.  While the build is still early, hopefully more intelligent enemies will show up upon release.\r\n<br/

href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=1135\">MotoGP 06</a> – Two-wheeled Cycle Excitement</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>After getting a taste of motorcycle racing, with Tourist Trophy for the PS2, I decided to try my hand at MotoGP 3.  After running two races on it, I felt that this was the better game of the two.  Admittedly, at first when I started racing in MotoGP 06, I couldn’t make the turns because I was riding the bike way too quickly.  However, after a bit I got the hang of it.  It didn’t mean that I never crashed, but controlling the cycle got much easier.  It was a much more natural feel than Tourist Trophy was, and the sense of speed was easily felt in MotoGP 06.</P>\r\n<P>In Tourist Trophy, the driver of the bike never looked too stiff coming off of a bike from a crash.  In MotoGP 06 the driver flails all-around realistically, and watching the driver sometimes makes your stomach turn with the force he is thrown off of the bike.</P>\r\n<P>The AI seemed to be consistent.  If you get behind in one of the races, don’t count on coming back into the pack.  You’ll be a lone rider in the back.  Sometimes you can nudge against other cyclists, and if you hit them right you can cause a crash with cascading results.  Any fans of the previous versions should be happy with MotoGP 06.\r\n<br/ ><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=1135\"><strong>>>Screenshots</strong></a>\r\n</P><br/ >\r\n<P>{image5:right}<STRONG><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=4107\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> – Too Sonic Superspeed?</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Although you might not think a game like Sonic the Hedgehog might be groundbreaking enough for a next-gen showcase, Sonic the Hedgehog really steps up the graphics and tries to bring back the days of the original Sonic and Sonic Adventure games.  The levels in the Sonic Adventure games really captured the look and feel of the original Sonic games in a 3D world.  Sonic the Hedgehog for the Xbox 360 brings back that feeling.  The bumpers, the rings and the level design really feel like something from the original games.  The enemies are given greater detail and feel a bit more menacing than the earlier models.</P>\r\n<P>Sonic now has a new range of moves at his disposal.  These include a slide to knock over enemies, and a spin-kick.  Some of these moves are able to assist him in breaking boxes and solve puzzles, but the standard jumping on the head of the enemy works the best most of the time.</P>\r\n<P>If there is any complaint I have about the game is Sonic almost seems to be going TOO fast.  That is a statement I never thought I would hear myself making.  Sonic travels at such a brisk pace that controlling him is hard to do on the long stretches you can find him on.  If you go too far over, you’ll end up crashing him into a wall, or worse, find him go over a cliff.  If Sega can fix this, I think they have a winner on their hands.\r\n<br/ ><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/screenshots/index.php?GameID=4107\"><strong>>>Screenshots</strong></a></P><br/ >\r\n<P>{image6:right}<STRONG><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=4112\">Chromehounds</a> – Bite My Shiny Metal Hound</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Giant metal robots seem to be a staple on Microsoft’s systems.  While the original Xbox had two MechAssault games and the behemoth Steel Battalion, Sega gets the Xbox 360 off the ground with Chromehounds.</P>\r\n<P>When first looking at Chromehounds, the screenshots for this game don’t do it justice.  These are some of the best graphics we’ve seen for the Xbox 360.  When the Hounds traverse over the land, you see them leave prints behind.  The missiles shot from you burn bright from the rocket.   Firing a smoke grenade turns the entire area smoky, giving you time to make a hasty retreat.  The movement of each Hound was smooth whether it moved from walking or treads.  Explosions are big and loud.</P>\r\n<P>Sega had two four-member teams set up in a multi-player map.  Each station was set up with a different type of Hound for each member of the team.  Apparently there is supposed to be a lead commander, but because of the fact that E3 is so loud, that feature couldn’t be truly implemented.  A mini-map is available on screen and it can be brought up at any time.  It doesn’t show the positioning of your enemies though.  I felt this was almost useless as I wasn’t able to tell where the fighting was taking place, and it could take a while to find a battle especially in a slow Hound.</P>\r\n<P>The controls are rather simple.  Right bumper switches weapon groups while the right trigger fires.  The weapons need to recharge or restock when they run out of the current “clip” of ammo, so you need to remember to switch weapons effectively.  A small screen in the upper right hand corner helps you aim your shots.</P>\r\n<P>Chromehounds looks good and should be a huge hit with Mech fans when it is released.\r\n<br/ ><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/screenshots/index.php?GameID=4112\"><strong>>>Screenshots</strong></a></P><br/ >\r\n<P>{image7:right}<STRONG><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/GameInfo/GameInfo.php?GameID=4703\">F.E.A.R.</a> – Come Get Scared a Second Time Around</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>F.E.A.R. is coming to the Xbox 360 after only being available on the PC.  Those who haven’t played the PC version should be able to get the same content available in the original game, with a strong possibility that the upcoming expansion is going to be included with the original game when the 360 version is released.</P>\r\n<P>In F.E.A.R. for the PC, the bullet time effect happened at certain points, but the player had no control over when it actually occurred.  The Xbox 360 version features the bullet time to be controlled by hitting the left bumper.  This should be a nice edition for the game.</P>\r\n<P>The AI of F.E.A.R. makes the enemies as intense in the PC game.  Enemies take cover, hide behind objects, and wait for you to come out of hiding areas.  They are very good shots too, making you look around before planning a spot.  You have to have a good aim to take care of these guys, and some are going to be much tougher than others.  Tactics take as much of a role as accuracy in taking down the larger enemies.</P>\r\n<P>The graphics for F.E.A.R. look excellent.  The screens of F.E.A.R. looked almost as good as those of a PC.  Those with an Xbox 360 who held off on buying F.E.A.R. on the PC because of the specs of their rig should be quite pleased with this version.\r\n<br/ ><a href=\"http://www.gamingtrend.com/screenshots/index.php?GameID=4703\"><strong>>>Screenshots</strong></a></P><br/

 ('156','E3 Preview- Too Human','{image1:left}<p>James O\'Reilly, Director of Technology for Silicon Knights, and Denis Dyack, Director  from Microsoft Studios, sat down with us in a closed-door appointment to show us an early version of Too Human.  Silicon Knights, as you may recall, are the developers behind the smash-hit Gamecube title Eternal Darkness.</p>\r\n<p>You play the role of Baldur, a cybernetically enhanced God.  You aren\'t a God in the traditional sense – that is to say that it isn\'t due to some divine power or lineage, but instead are considered a God because of your incredible powers that you\'ve obtained through cybernetic modifications. You\'ll need every cybernetic trick up your sleeve too as an army of machines is pushing to wipe out the entirety of mankind.  </p>\r\n<p>The game, despite initial suggestions to the contrary, is actually a deep role playing game with roots in Nordic lore and martial arts.  Coordinating efforts with a studio called “Fast”, Silicon Knights has incorporated literally hundreds of martial arts systems including motion captured longstaff combat, sword combat, two-stick fighting, hammers, weapons akimbo, heavy weapons and far more.  Roughly 9 classes of melee and 9 classes of gunplay types are included in the game, but these are further subdivided into specialty combinations. While we were only able to see longstaff and sword, it was already apparent that a lot of work has been put into the variety of action.    </p>\r\n{image2:right}<p>Silicon Knights wants to get away from the often-used system of Cutscene – Gameplay – Cutscene – Gameplay.  Obviously this tends to have people rush through the gameplay portions to see the next pre-rendered story portion.  Instead of reusing that formula, Silicon Knights has worked hard to create a functional and intuitive camera system over the last 7 years that creates a more cinematic and dynamic camera system that is intelligent about the environment and the storyline, and reacts accordingly.  By utilizing a computer-controlled camera that swings close for melee attacks but backs up for most ranged weapon strikes, they have freed up the second analog as a system for executing complex martial arts techniques.  Comparisons to World of Warcraft mixed with Diablo were easy to draw, due to the epic weapons and armor sets that you can obtain in the game.  Additionally, these epic weapons and armors, as well as your normal gear, can take location-specific damage.  Just like in Terminator, when the machine scanned his individual body parts for damage, your armor will show a grid-like impact effect when it is hit.  This means that locational damage is already being planned for the title.  This damage can affect things such as how well you can jump, use a gun with a steady arm, how fast you can run, and so much more.  Since enemies move in packs, and squad leaders to back them up, it will be imparative that you maintain these different armor systems.  </p>{pagebreak} \r\n{image3:left}<p>Moving into the combat aspects of the game, Silicon Knights are looking to make the fighting portions so intuitive that anyone can pick it up with roughly 15 to 30 seconds of practice.  To fully demonstrate this effect, the developers handed the controller to me to try it out.  Indeed, after roughly 30 seconds I was fully familiar with the controls and taking out enemies in a spectacular fashion.  Very few titles manage to pull of this level of control precision at launch, much less this early in the game.  It was impressive.  </p>\r\n<p>One of the main subplots of the story involves your cybernetic nature.  What is the moral implications of a fully biomodified human being?  Since you can replace nearly every part of your body with cybernetics, if you do so, are you still human?  Do you still have a soul, or are you a machine now?  We\'ll have to wait a while to answer this question...</p>\r\n<p>Not all of the action takes place in the sterile world of the future.  You can also jack into Cyberspace, a fictional world that shows what the world \'should be\' rather than what it is.  Flowing rivers, grass bending in the wind, trees growing, and more illustrate a sort of utopia within your mind.  This area contains some of the histories of the real world, as well as ancient lost technologies.  Not just a scenic waypoint, it also serves to advance the story, and things that happen in the world of Cyberspace can affect things within the real world.  </p>\r\n{image4:right}<p>Too Human will be able to be played over Xbox Live in a cooperative multiplayer environment.  While we were not shown too much on the multiplayer, it was confirmed that your character from the single game, will be able to used in multiplayer.</p>\r\nAlthough this title was early in the development cycle, the overall look and feel of the game was clearly coming together.  Look for more information on the title as it begins to take shape.','James O\'Reilly, Director of Technology for Silicon Knights, and Denis Dyack, Director  from Microsoft Studios, sat down with us in a closed-door appointment to show us an early version of Too Human.','2006-05-13','25','1','2006','e3preview','/Photos/1147505151.gif','/Photos/1147507262.jpg','/Photos/1147507276.jpg','/Photos/1147507294.jpg','','','','','',''),
 ('158','E3 preview- Brothers In Arms: Hells Highway','{image1:left}<p>The World War II setting has been used for several game settings, especially in the first person shooter genre.  It could be claimed that the first big first-person shooter was Wolfenstein 3D.  Since then, we’ve been mowing down Nazis like no one’s business.  Since then games have become more complex, and some might claim that the WWII shoot have become more complex.  Ubisoft’s Brothers in Arms series has been a successful mix of action and strategy.  Now Ubisoft wants to up the ante with Hell’s Highway.</p>\r\n<p>In Hell’s Highway you play a paratrooper in September 1944.  You are in Eindhoven, Holland, and the city is actually modeled from the actual city.  Using photos from that area and trips by the developers, the city looks shockingly realistic to the real thing. It’s also based on the largest Airborne operation in the history of the world.  Because of the number of losses taken during the operation, this stretch of land was nicknamed Hell’s Highway.</p>\r\n<p>Starting the game you are in a building shooting the breeze with a bunch of your fellow soldiers.  Each one had different dialects and the facial expressions of the soldiers truly reflected what they were saying.  In mid-conversation, the windows completely explode and chaos ensues.  A large shard of glass is lodged inside your arm.  You get it pulled out by another soldier, and you are off into the action.</p>\r\n{image2:right}<p>Instead of one squad from the first games, there are two squads you work with.  One is directly under your control, while the second supports your team.  Used in conjunction with each other, you are a formidable force, but it can also cause chaos if you aren’t aware of their position.</p>\r\n<p>Since you are in a city, you also have civilians that you can accidentally shoot, so just because it moves, it doesn’t mean you should shoot it.  That also applies to your enemies.  In one scene, two Nazis were carrying an injured soldier with them.  You could shoot them there, but following them led you to the 88’s anti-aircraft guns.  This is important since your compass doesn’t have an indicator of where your objective is.  Using your environment is needed to figure out where to go.</p>{pagebreak}\r\n{image3:left}<p>Commanding troops is similar to the other games.  A cursor shows up on the screen and you can command the entire squad to go there, but you can also command specific team members to move to that area.  If you have the cursor over an enemy, you command your teammates to shoot at them.  This can give you suppression fire to flank the enemy.  Sometimes the enemy is waiting for your flank attempt.  Ubisoft wants the game to be about your leadership just as much as your aim with a gun.</p>\r\n<p>One of the first things you notice in BIA: HH is the fact that there is no real HUD.  When you give an order, you hear you command your team and see your arm indicate where to go.  Sometimes you’ll shout your order out, but at other times you hear a loud whisper.  When you climb over a wall, you see your hands and feet.  This makes you feel more like a real person instead of a disembodied camera.</p>\r\n<p>Your guys make mistakes as well.  While watching your squad climb over a short wall, one of your teammates stumbles and lands on his backside.  Another member of your squad goes to him and helps pick him up.  This helps make your teammates seem more alive.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most impressive displays of firepower came from the 88’s.  During the demo the anti-aircraft gun hit a brick building.  The bricks exploded around the chimney and a corner of the building fell onto the road.  You are then able to use that for cover from the fire.  It’s a great game mechanic and really gives the game a next-gen feel.</p>\r\n<p>Fans of the Brothers in Arms series are in for a treat when this comes out for the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC late this year.</p>','Ubisoft’s Brothers in Arms series has been a successful mix of action and strategy.  Now Ubisoft wants to up the ante with Hell’s Highway.','2006-05-13','25','1','2006','e3preview','/Photos/1147506093.gif','/Photos/1147507583.jpg','/Photos/1147507594.jpg','','','','','','',''),
 ('159','Haze E3 Preview','{image1:left}<P>In the world of <B>Haze</B>, budgetary cutbacks have forced the government to farm out control of the military to a monolithic corporation called Mantel. Mantel has its fingers in everything from bio-engineering to industrial complexes. Substitute the name Umbrella and you’re close, but Mantel comes off as more Wall Street-friendly than the Resident Evil baddie. I loved the ad on the E3 show floor that featured a Scott Glen look-a-like praising Mantel as the salvation of the world. This is the kind of ad that would fit perfectly in the Robocop universe, and I hope it finds its way online soon. It’s very funny when taken in the context of what happens in <B>Haze</B>.</P>\r\n<P>Part of the Mantel training program involves a special drug called Haze that renders subjects more acceptable to suggestion. The game itself is still a year or so away from completion so that was about all the story the dev team would give up, but if <B>Haze</B> is anything like the dozen existing storylines involving corporate malfeasance we can extrapolate the following: At some point there will be an event that permanently snaps the main character out of his (or her) drug-induced stupor causing him (or her) to see the light so they will try to figure out exactly what Mantel is doing to the rest of its test subjects. Trying to take over the world would be my guess. Barring that, the main character will raise hell by destroying everything in sight with Mantel swearing vengeance, yaddaa, yaddaa, yaddaa.</P>\r\n<P>We watched the devs play it on the PS3 and Haze looked breathtaking. Say what you will about the cost of Sony’s new machine but that little bugger can render top-notch visuals like a champ. The jungle environment we saw in action would have been considered a cut scene this time last year. The player starts by riding into a hot zone in a helicopter that lands, kicks you and your squad out, then takes back off while additional reinforcements fly in. The squad was immediately attacked by guerillas that blended in well with the backdrop. In most games you see a targeting reticule signaling where the tangos are, but I didn’t see that here. This may just be me personally but I actually enjoyed that. It means you have to work for your money to take them out, thus kicking the challenge up a notch.</P>\r\n{image2:right}<P>You also have the choice of whether or not to issue out orders to your squad. Normally in a squad-based game, you have to issue attack/follow/defend/cook me dinner orders to get your squad to do anything. Haze is supposed to be different in that the AI will act independently if you do not issue directions to them. Right now the enemy AI is a little off because we watched enemy troops charge right through the player’s squad with no regard for seeking cover.</P>\r\n<P>It’s early yet.</P>\r\n{pagebreak}{image3:left}<P>Once the squad cleared the area using a combination of grenades and flanking maneuvers, they moved forward towards and ran into a civilian who promptly surrendered. One of the other soldiers promptly shot him and that’s when <B>Haze</B> became something to watch. Up to this point, it was a standard squad-based tactical FPS with a shiny new coat, but the civilian didn’t just fall to the ground like he would in another title. He clutched at his profusely bleeding stomach wound, rolled on the ground in agony and begged for mercy for almost a full 30 seconds.</P>\r\n<P>That’s the exact point I realized someone has finally utilized the next-generation consoles. It may seem odd to single out an unsettling event as the moment when gaming might change, but the very fact that I was unsettled by it means the barrier between gaming fantasy and reality will blur soon enough. The <B>Haze</B> demo ended then and we talked a little bit more about it.</P>\r\n<P>The engine is brand new and built from the ground up. The visuals come complete with heavy emphasis on HDR, light bloom and extensive texturing. <B>Haze</B> follows the player over the course of 48 straight hours and the time will reflect that. The sun will set, night will fall, and the sun will rise again during your quest and I can only imagine how good the shadow effects might be. Weather patterns will change as well so you might be running through the jungle and find yourself in a rain forest monsoon. This should make heavy gunfights even more exciting, in theory at least.</P>\r\n<P>One thing that will make a difference in the single player game is the co-op multiplayer mode. Normally this would be the typical two-person job but according to the developers this could heavily influence the main campaign. For example, say you need to attack a heavily fortified enemy position and you can’t do it alone. Conceivably you and a buddy can tag-team it in co-op then when you go back to that area in the single player campaign you’ll find the results still smoldering. Frankly, that’s a killer idea and one that I’d like to see implemented.</P>\r\n<P>The game is slated to hit next-gen consoles in Spring of 2007 so we should see more as the year unfolds. Hopefully it will live up to its promise, but we’ll find out for sure in the coming months.</P>\r\n<P>-Mitch Youngblood</P>','Haze E3 Preview','2006-05-13','7','1','2006','e3preview','/Photos/1147757724.gif','/Photos/1147757740.jpg','/Photos/1147757751.jpg','','','','','','',''),

Shark Man of the Delta – was born November 21, 1940 in Lansford, Pennsylvania. A Navy man for over 30 years, Dick’s military experience covered a wide range of billets requiring Special Warfare expertise.&nbsp; The majority of these billets were in direct combat roles or crises management positions in direct support of the National Command Authority, which collectively refers to the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense.&nbsp; </P>\r\n<P>His experience began after he enlisted in the US Navy in 1958 where he worked as a teletype operator at the Naval Air Station in Naples, Italy. He eventually worked his way into the Navy\'s Underwater Demolition Teams. During two tours in Vietnam serving as a Navy SEAL, Marcinko was awarded numerous medals including the Silver Star, four Bonze Stars with a Combat V, two Navy Commendation Medals, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star. Marcinko and his SEAL platoon became such a problem for the enemy that the Viet Cong posted a reward of 50,000 piasters for his death. </P>\r\n<P>After his time in Vietnam, he took a staff position at Little Creek Naval Base, followed by a stint in Monterrey, CA where he earned his B.A. in International Relations from the U.S. Navy Postgraduate School. In 1973 he reported to duty as a Naval Attaché to Cambodia where he spent 14 months advising (and actively assisting) the Cambodians in their fight with the Khmer Rouge. He left in 1975 to become the commanding officer of SEAL Team Two. </P>\r\n<P>From SEAL Team TWO he attended the USAF Air Command &amp; Staff College in Montgomery, Alabama and earned a MA in Political Science from Auburn University. He was then stationed at&nbsp; the Pentagon where he served as a special operations planner assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While there, he assisted in the planning and training for the Iranian hostage dilemma, was the primary action officer for the maintenance of special warfare/unconventional warfare plans worldwide, served as the Navy representative to assist in the establishment of Rapid Deployment Force (RDF), and handled the daily intelligence for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy.</P>\r\n<P>From there, Marcinko sold the idea and was eventually tasked with creating and commanding SEAL Team SIX, the Navy’s first and only counter-terrorist command. SEAL Team SIX engaged in highly classified missions from Central America to the Middle East, the North Sea to Africa and beyond, and established itself as the world’s foremost counter-terrorism unit.</P>\r\n<P>Marcinko later was named commanding officer and founder of a second counter-terrorism unit, Red Cell. Commanding Red Cell, Marcinko was directed to use his team to test the Navy\'s anti-terrorist capabilities. As a result he was able to infiltrate seemingly impenetrable, highly-secured bases, nuclear submarines, ships and other purported \"secure areas\", including the U.S. Presidential plane Air Force One. In doing so he reportedly embarrassed several superior officers, whom he accuses of involvement in his subsequent conviction for misappropriation of funds and resources under his command.</P>\r\n<P>His experiences led to The New York Times best-selling autobiography Rogue Warrior, as well as subsequent fictional novels in a series called “Rogue Warrior,” nine of which he co-wrote with John Weisman and three, most recently, with Jim DeFelice. Additionally, Marcinko has written three management and leadership books. He is currently under contract with Jim DeFelice for two additional fiction novels with TOR Publishing. </P>\r\n<P>Marcinko is a spokesperson for Zodiac Boats Maritime Training Academy, Oakley Sunglasses, and is currently designing two knives as a Rogue Warrior series for Strider Knives. </P>\r\n<P>He is now Chairman of the Board of Red Cell International Corp., a private security consulting firm based in Washington, DC, whose clients have included the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the White House Fellows, and the U.S. Army War College. He also serves as President of Richard Marcinko, Inc. and President of SOS Temps, Inc., a motivational and team-building company, which counts among its clients General Motors, AT&amp;T, Domino\'s Pizza, Motorola, BellSouth, and several other Fortune 500 companies. </P>\r\n<P>Through Eastern Michigan University, Marcinko also provides graduate-level presentations on topics such as terrorism, security, and the adaptation of modern technology. He also speaks at the National Defense University and at George Mason University, discussing the terrorism vulnerabilities facing the Nation.

Unfortunately, as krogan society become more technologically advanced so did their weaponry.</P>\r\n<P style=\"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in\">Four thousand years ago, at the dawn of the krogan nuclear age, battles to claim the small pockets of territory capable of sustaining life escalated into full scale global war.

Krogan reproduce and mature at an astonishing rate. Their large shoulder humps store fluids and nutrients, enabling them to survive extended periods without food or water. Their thick hides are virtually impervious to cuts, scrapes or contusions, and they are highly resistant to toxins, radiation and extremes of both heat and cold. Biotic individuals are rare, though those who do possess the talent are typically quite strong in their abilities. But their most amazing physiological features are the multiple instances of major organs; these secondary systems are capable of serving as back-ups in the event of damage to the primary biological structures.

They were liberated from this state by the salarians, who “culturally uplifted” the krogan by giving them advanced technology and relocating them to a planet not cursed with lethal levels of radiation, toxins or deadly predators. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>But the salarian intervention was not without an ulterior motive. At the time the Citadel was engaged in a prolonged galactic war with the rachni, a race of intelligent space-faring insects. The salarians hoped the krogan would join the Citadel forces as soldiers to stand against an otherwise unstoppable foe. The plan worked to perfection: within two generations the rapidly breeding krogan had the numbers to not only drive the advancing rachni back, but pursue them to their home worlds and eradicate the entire species.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>For a brief period the krogan were hailed as the saviors of the galaxy. But without the harsh conditions of Tuchanka to keep their numbers in check, their population exploded. Over crowded and running out of resources on their new home planet, the krogan spread out to forcibly claim other worlds… worlds already inhabited by races loyal to the Citadel.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The so-called Krogan Rebellions continued for nearly three centuries. The krogan sustained massive casualties, but their incredible birth-rate kept their population steadily increasing. Victory seemed inevitable. In desperation, the Council turned to the recently discovered Turian Empire for aid.

For their role in quelling the Krogan Rebellions the turians were rewarded with a seat on the Citadel Council. The krogan, on the other hand, still suffer from the incurable effects of the genophage. Over the last millennium krogan numbers have steadily declined, leaving them a scattered and dying people. Faced with the certainty of their extinction as a species, most krogan have become individualistic and completely self-interested. They typically serve as mercenaries for hire to the highest bidder, though many still resent and despise the Citadel races who condemned them to their tragic fate.<BR>','The Rise and Fall of the Krogan (Mass Effect story)','2007-06-25','27','1','2006','e3preview','','','','','','','','','',''),
 ('255','E3 \'07 Preview: Enemy Territory Quake Wars','{image1:left}<P><STRONG>Enemy Territory Quake Wars<BR></STRONG>Platforms: PC with PS3, Xbox 360, OSX, and Linux coming later</P>\r\n<P>You might recall that I met up with Paul “Locki” Wedgwood to take a good look at the Splash Damage / id Software / Activision collaboration, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.  Even though that was just a few months ago, I met up with Paul again to see how the game was shaping up for the Public Beta launch.  I was surprised by a few things he had to say, but I was even more surprised at what I saw. </P>\r\n<P>Enemy Territory: Quake Wars utilizes the “MegaTexture” technology that John Carmack and his team at id Software put together.  It essentially takes ultra high resolution textures and essentially ‘paints’ them onto less complex models allowing more mid-ranged PCs to handle what looks like high end detail.  At the previous event the graphics looked pretty outstanding, but there were some minor details that just didn’t quite mesh.  Some animations seemed stiff, and some detail on the models hadn’t come together quite yet.  Well, I can’t say that anymore.  Each model had gotten a great deal of adjustment, with animations becoming smooth and less ‘floaty’.  Additionally the character models looked vastly improved with minor details such as reflection on the GDF sniper visor or a more visceral look overall for the Strogg forces.</P>\r\n{image2:right} <P>Another area that received additional attention is the map system.  The previous build that I saw showed territories split on the map, but the new look is more intuitive and easier to read at a glance.  You can now see where your team is converging on the enemy, which helps you know where your chosen class is needed.  </P>\r\n<P>Splash Damage doesn’t want to create maps that fit into previous ‘pigeon holes’.  They don’t want players to think “This is the ice map, this is the lava map, this is the city map” with little beyond that initial impression to make the level memorable.  To that end they have made their maps very different.  We got to see a new map called “The Ark” that takes place on a Norwegian Fjord.  The goal of the GDF in this mission is to assault a series of BioDomes, destroying a Stroggification plant held within.  Given that this is one of the last lush and untouched areas on Earth, the GDF see it as symbolic of a ‘last Eden’ as well, giving it emotional value. With 12 unique campaign maps shipping in the box, they are striving to make the maps more about pursuing military objectives through coordination and team dynamics, and less about deathmatch and capturing flags.  To that end, we got another look at the dynamic objective system.</P>\r\n{image3:left}<P>Everything in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars has a counter.  Artillery can be countered with a shield generator.  Vehicles can be countered with Anti-Vehicle turrets or rocket troops.  Snipers are countered by radar, tired can be popped on wheeled vehicles, and mines can take out tracked vehicles.  To help guide players to those counters, Splash Damage has instituted a dynamic mission system.  This system will suggest missions based on your class, and your team’s progress through the overarching assault.  For instance, during the Sewers mission (the same mission that can be played in the public beta), the primary initial mission is to destroy a shield generator.  If you are a constructor you may be asked instead to construct a pair of guard towers, as well as seizing a forward spawn point.  If you are a Soldier you’ll be asked to destroy a larger gate that would allow tanks to roll into the shield generator area.  Each class is given a variety of objectives that dynamically update throughout your progress.   Other players can also give you objective updates through their requests.  If you are a Medic and a player requests healing, you’ll receive that as a mission and see their icon with an Ankh over them on your map.  You’ll always have something to do.</P>\r\n<P>As I mentioned, Splash Damage has launched their Public Beta recently, and the game can’t be that far off from release.  Seeing it come together as well as it has in the last two months gives hope that this could be our next Friday Night Fight title.  Jump into the Beta and see for yourself!</P>\r\n<P>-- Ron Burke, Director of Gaming Trend</P>','E3 \'07 Preview: Enemy Territory Quake Wars','2007-07-10','3','1','2007','e3preview','/Photos/1184120348.gif','/Photos/1184138061.jpg','/Photos/1184138073.jpg','','','','','','',''),

Griggs deployed via fastrope onto a terrorist held freighter.  Dropped directly in front of the Forecastle on the boat, the team took immediate action, capitalizing on shock and awe tactics to execute the terrorists captaining the boat right through the glass doors.  The AIs immediately began clearing rooms, calling “Hallway clear, move out” and the like as they moved.  Rain effects and dynamic lighting danced across the deck of the boat as what looked like an MH-53M Pave Low helicopter provided cover fire for your team.  </P>\r\n<P>Providing constant feedback such as “One Ready, Two Ready!” your team worked their way through the ship, making their way down to the cargo hold.  As your team breached the hold, enemies scattered like roaches to seek cover behind various boxes and machinery.  Your objective is to recover a shipment manifest from this hold, but unfortunately this ship is in dire peril – it is sinking and on fire.  Snatching the scrap of paper from the briefcase, your team makes a hectic egress from the boat amid flying debris and flames.  The epic musical score swells as your team runs up the rapidly sinking ship, leaping to their fastropes just as the vessel capsizes – this is Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.  </P>\r\n<P>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare tells two stories of global conflict, the first fighting with American Force Recon Marines, and the second with Loyalist Russian SAS forces.  Your target is a Russian Ultra-Nationalist named Zackia and his 3 cohorts – together they make up a group called “The Four Horsemen”. </P>\r\n{image1:right}<P>The Call of Duty series is known for well scripted single player that tells a compelling story, and this game doesn’t look like it’ll be breaking that plan.  The game is said to have action ranging from high intensity infantry combat, or acting as a gunner for a Cobra attack helicopter, to a clandestine mission 15 years in the past for the Russians.  </P>\r\n<P>Not content to settle with just the initial impression, Infinity Ward moved onto a really quick look at a mission called “Death from Above”.  This mission takes place in Chechnya where you act as a gunner on an AC-130 Spectre Gunship.  Troops on the ground have used strobe markings to spot targets for you.  Utilizing white-hot and black-hot thermal vision, you’ll provide fire support for ground troops using the 25mm Gatling gun, the 40mm Gatling gun, and the incredibly powerful 105mm.howitzer.  This short demonstration was punctuated by radio squawk like “Kaboom baby!  Hell yea!” and other feedback from the ground and from other members of your crew.  </P>\r\n<P>The final area we got to take a closer look at was called The Bog.  Acting as a member of 1st Force Recon, you are in a country in the Middle East, on top of a very exposed bridge.  Moving forward on foot, there is smoke dotting the horizon and the landscape around you, downed choppers burning into molten wreckage nearby.  Your team will yell out “Contact on the overpass! Get on the roof and hit it with the Javelin – destroy the armored vehicles on the overpass!”  Using night vision goggles and laser sights, you’ll assault a downtown apartment building to reach the roof.  Clearing darkened rooms, you’ll have to keep your night vision off to fire your weapon as the muzzle flash will blind you.  Keeping an eye out for friendlies who are marked by strobe flash markers, you’ll face combatants who have the home field advantage.  Engaging hostiles at close range and having to rely on your SOG knife for stealth seemed far more intense than the previous titles set in World War II.  Having finally reached the roof, you’ll deploy the Javelin.  Following a triangle-type arch that rockets the missile upwards and then directly down on top of its target, you’ll take out hostile armor on the bridge with incredible precision.  Flares light the night sky as you try to secure a friendly tank against RPG troops.  Planting an IR beacon to bring in a pair of Cobra attack choppers, the mission ends with a rain of hellfire.  Destructible items in the environment splinter and explode all around you – this game looks like a pretty big cut about its predecessor, both in terms of graphic quality, and intensity.  </P>\r\n{image2:left}<P>While we didn’t get to see the multiplayer, the team that build the Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2 multiplayer has been working solely on the multiplayer code from day one of development.  We were told that aspects of the multiplayer game will unlock through the single player game.  The idea is that you’ll create a class and then have a cornucopia of options to create your own custom soldier, including GPS Jammers to remain invisible on radar, increased spring speed, lighter firearms, silenced SMGs, shoulder-fired rockets, and more.  Snipers be aware that the GPS won’t save you though – the kill-cam is back, but also tells the enemy what you have equipped so they might counter you.</P>\r\n<P>Call of Duty 4 is slated for a release at the end of this year, with a closed beta coming very soon.  Infinity Ward has brought this game out of the 40s and into the modern world.  While the PS3 and 360 versions haven’t been announced yet, the success of the previous titles almost demands it.  Stay tuned for more on Call of Duty 4 as E3 unfolds.<BR></P>\r\n<P>-- Ron Burke, Director of Gaming Trend</P>','E3 \'07 Preview: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare','2007-07-10','3','1','2007','e3preview','/Photos/1184138143.jpg','/Photos/1184138153.jpg','/Photos/1184138276.gif','','','','','','',''),

The expansive story, created under direction from George Lucas, is set during the largely unexplored era between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. In it, players will assist the iconic villain in his quest to rid the universe of Jedi - and face decisions that could change the course of their destiny.<BR><BR>As its name implies, The Force Unleashed completely re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force by taking full advantage of newly developed technologies that will be seen and experienced for the first time: Digital Molecular Matter (DMM), by Pixelux Entertainment, and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd. Paired with the powerful Havok Physics™ system, these new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consoles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of anything in the environment so that everything reacts exactly like it should - wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, plants on the planet Felucia bend like plants on the planet Felucia would, and more. Meanwhile, as a revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move, act and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior on the fly and resulting in a different payoff every single time. <BR><BR></P>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>During the period between Episodes III and IV, players hunt Jedi in the role of Darth Vader\'s Secret Apprentice. \r\n<LI>Unleash and upgrade the Secret Apprentice\'s four core Force powers - Force push, grip, repulse and lightning - throughout the course of the game, and combine them for ultra-destructive, never-before-seen combos. \r\n<LI>Examples of unleashing the Force in ways never thought possible: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>The Secret Apprentice won\'t just Force push enemies into walls - he\'ll Force push enemies through walls. \r\n<LI>The Secret Apprentice won\'t just Force grip foes to throw them aside - he\'ll Force grip them in midair, zap them with lightning, then drop them to the ground to explode like a bomb.</LI></UL>\r\n<LI>In addition to new adversaries created just for the game, such as fugitive Jedi and Force-sensitive Felucians, players will also confront and associate with familiar faces from the Star Wars films, including Darth Vader. </LI></UL>','RP','1','3','2007-04-06','2007-04-06'),

They will be showing the game to publishers at selected meetings during the 2005 Game Developer\'s Conference in March.<br />\r\n<blockquote>6GUN is a third person, tactical-action, modern combat game. In 6GUN you are the leader of an assault team in the highly classified GUNSLINGER program operated by the Special Operations Command (SOCOM). When diplomacy fails, and the US government needs a \"deniable\" military solution to its problems abroad, they call on the GUNSLINGERS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe GUNSLINGER record of successful missions was recently shattered with a failed operation, and political pressures have relegated them to the second string of Special Operations while better known groups are assigned the best missions. GUNSLINGER Assault Team 2 is assigned a new leader (the player) and given equipment and personnel recovery missions in South America. In the course of the mission in the jungles of South America, the GUNSLINGERS discover surprisingly detailed information about Typhoon Class Ballistic Missile Submarines and the Soviet Northern Fleet in the possession of an international arms trafficker. Soon after, a Typhoon in the port of Primorsk for disarmament is attacked and boarded. A SOCOM operation to retake the sub ends in the detonation of a nuclear device and loss of an entire SEAL team, leaving the world in shock, and SOCOM in chaos.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result, the GUNSLINGERS are thrust back onto the center stage in the world of clandestine operations and begin to hunt those responsible for the attack in Primorsk. The hunt will take the player through 4 campaigns and at least 12 different levels, giving the avid gamer hours and hours of exciting combat gameplay! Gameplay will range from small unit combat, to close quarters battle (CQB), hostage rescue, demolitions, sniping from a helicopter gunship, High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) parachute insertions, and take the GUNSLINGERS around the world. 6GUN will be released on the PC, Xbox and PS2 in 2006.</blockquote>Sounds like an interesting game concept, and we\'ll try to keep on top of this one to see what publisher jumps on it.','6GUN Announced.','2005-02-22 12:51:49','27','0','1'),

Here\'s a little bit to whet your appetite.<blockquote>Mike Thies (Woot Radio):	The other thing that a lot of folks are concerned about in a lot of games especially for MMOs anymore is character customization.  If you are going to play a human, and obviously you are going to end up being part of the military, you are going to end up in a uniform, which means there are not a lot of options there for your character to be truly unique and represent yourself, which is something that games like City of Heroes and City of Villains have really set the standard for as far as making someone stand out in a crowd.  How are you going to accomplish something similar? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoe Ybarra (Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment):	Wow!  That is a tough question to answer because we are in the middle of deciding exactly how we want to enact that as we speak.  But a short answer to your question is the fact that in addition to the standard military material…and your observation is correct.  The show is dominated by humans so one of the goals that we have here is to try to create original set of races that the players can play so that there is diversity from that standpoint.  But when you look at the actual…what am I wearing?  And what is my persona in the game?  We certainly have other things to draw from than just Air Force uniforms.  In particular what we look at is how we mix technology into that.  As you go further up the ranks here in terms of levels you will have access to equipment such as space suits and various other kinds of use that will allow the user to look very different.  When we start pioneering things like (inaudible)…that is usable as equipment and armor and various other things.  We can have a very distinctive look to the game. Another aspect of it is that the show has made a turn in that area as well by introducing characters that are not Air Force.  So we will have a fair amount of flexibility here with how we, if you will, clothe our customers and make them look unique because we understand how important that really is. </blockquote>Stargate Worlds is currently in early development, and we look to have much more on this title over the rest of this year and likely into next.

We wanted to game to feel a bit more gothic and “savage” by adding a bit more adult theme to it (not too far mind you). Savage 1’s graphics were good, but not GREAT. We charged ourselves with making a game with excellent art in an awesome engine capable of making that art shine. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nI would guess that our number one priority was to give Savage 2 the polish it needs to really win fans over. With the use of (1) a higher tech engine (2) higher quality models, textures, and animations (3) effects and particles that rival the best in the business and (4) an interface that is very intuitive to use, is very sharp and clean, gives tons of feedback and information, and helps players fully understand how to play the game.</blockquote>You can read the full interview <a href=\"http://www.gamecloud.com/article.php?article_id=3679\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>.','Savage 2 Interview','2006-02-27 14:44:24','7','0','1'),

This is what he had to say regarding the multiplayer:<blockquote>Yeah, we\'ve got four main modes, including Tactical Deathmatch, Tactical Team Deathmatch and Tactical Capture The Flag. The reason we have \'tactical\' in front of the name is, with the additions of the player\'s suit and the different weapons and ammunition, it means each of the modes has a new kind of play. It\'s changed inherently because it gives each of the modes a new kind of dynamic. For example, during a Team Deathmatch game you could simply shoot down an opposing helicopter, or you could choose to put the pilot to sleep - it completely changes the nature of the gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen we have a mode called Power Struggle, which features economics and that\'s like an unlockable shopping tree or list if you like, for certain equipment like weapons and vehicles. It\'s based around a US force and revolves around alien artefacts and technology.

For 2000 years, the Krogan were reduced to primitive warring clans struggling to survive a nuclear winter of their own creation until they were discovered by the salarians. Similar to other reptilian species, the Krogan reproduce and mature at an astonishing rate, while their thick hides are virtually impervious to cuts, scrapes or contusions. However, the Krogan’s most amazing physiological feature of the species, are the multiple instances of major organs; these secondary systems are capable of serving as back-ups in the event of damage to the primary biological structures, making the Krogan incredibly difficult to kill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo learn more about the Krogan and view new screenshots, visit the “Mass Effect” Web site, which will be updated on a regular basis. Throughout the month we’ll continue to uncover more “Mass Effect” information and details on the Krogan race, so keep your eyes peeled for additional posts.</blockquote>You can check out all of the screenshots <a href=\"http://gamingtrend.com/screenshots/index.php?GameID=4193\">right here</a>.','Mass Effect Update','2007-06-15 09:57:43','7','0','1'),

To view 6GUN in game screen shots, concept art and characters, visit <A href=\"http://battleborne.com\">http://battleborne.com</A>.</P>\r\n<P>About BattleBorne\'s 6GUN:</P>\r\n<P>6GUN is a third person, tactical-action, modern combat game. In 6GUN you are the leader of an assault team in the highly classified GUNSLINGER program operated by the Special Operations Command (SOCOM). When diplomacy fails, and the US government needs a \"deniable\" military solution to its problems abroad, they call on the GUNSLINGERS.</P>\r\n<P>The GUNSLINGER record of successful missions was recently shattered with a failed operation, and political pressures have relegated them to the second string of Special Operations while better known groups are assigned the best missions. GUNSLINGER Assault Team 2 is assigned a new leader (the player) and given equipment and personnel recovery missions in South America. In the course of the mission in the jungles of South America, the GUNSLINGERS discover surprisingly detailed information about Typhoon Class Ballistic Missile Submarines and the Soviet Northern Fleet in the possession of an international arms trafficker. Soon after, a Typhoon in the port of Primorsk for disarmament is attacked and boarded. A SOCOM operation to retake the sub ends in the detonation of a nuclear device and loss of an entire SEAL team, leaving the world in shock, and SOCOM in chaos.</P>\r\n<P>As a result, the GUNSLINGERS are thrust back onto the center stage in the world of clandestine operations and begin to hunt those responsible for the attack in Primorsk. The hunt will take the player through 4 campaigns and at least 12 different levels, giving the avid gamer hours and hours of exciting combat gameplay! Gameplay will range from small unit combat, to close quarters battle (CQB), hostage rescue, demolitions, sniping from a helicopter gunship, High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) parachute insertions, and take the GUNSLINGERS around the world. 6GUN will be released on the PC, Xbox and PS2 in 2006.</P>\r\n<P>Sneak Peek screen shots and 6GUN concept art can be found at <A href=\"http://www.battleborne.com\">www.battleborne.com</A>.</P>\r\n<P>-- 6GUN will be shown to publishers at scheduled meetings during GDC 2005; to schedule a meeting please contact Lael Rose directly.</P>\r\n<P>About BattleBorne\'s Combat Elite(TM): WWII Paratroopers:</P>\r\n<P>BattleBorne\'s first title BattleBorne\'s Combat Elite: WWII Paratroopers has been unavoidably delayed due to the demise of Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.

The sequel will feature enhanced character models; higher quality animations; bump mapping; realistic, reflective water effects; dynamic shadows; point lighting; and an enhanced particle/spell effect system.</P>\r\n<P>Gameplay will be greatly superior, as well, due to a vastly improved melee system; an enhanced, officer-based battle grouping system; 20-unit, class-based system; FPS fast-action-paced gameplay for certain types of characters, third-person RPG, slower-paced gameplay for others; better items with more RPG elements; and an improved spell-casting system. The game will also feature a comprehensive single-player tutorial/training -- something that many \"Savage\" fans requested, and S2 Games feels is necessary in order to shorten the learning curve of a detailed game such as this.</P>\r\n<P>\"Our goal at S2 Games has always been to create the most compelling and fun PC game out there -- the kind of game that we would never get tired of playing,\" said Marc DeForest, co-founder and lead designer of S2 Games. \"`Savage\' was our opening salvo into the PC game market and we\'re happy to have the opportunity to follow it up with an even greater game in `Savage 2.\'\"</P>\r\n<P>Like the original \"Savage,\" \"Savage 2\" is a truly unique gaming experience that enables the player to opt for either the fast-paced, run-and-gun action of a FPS or the more cerebral and tactical planning of a RTS (playing as a Commander). With the creation of a new gameplay genre, the RTSS, the original \"Savage\" expertly redefined the first-person shooter and real-time strategy genres by combining elements of both into one cohesive experience. \"Savage 2: A Tortured Soul\" will preserve all of what made \"Savage\" a hit while continuing to deliver bleeding-edge innovation to the gaming audience.</P>\r\n<P>\"`Savage\' was really our baby, the game that we as an independent game developer cut our teeth on,\" said Jesse Hayes, co-founder and lead designer at S2 Games. \"We learned a great deal with `Savage\' and that experience, combined with great advice and constructive criticism from our audience means that `A Tortured Soul\' is going to completely blow gamers away!\"</P>\r\n<P>For more information on \"Savage 2: A Tortured Soul,\" please visit <A href=\"http://savage2.s2games.com\">http://savage2.s2games.com</A>.</P>\r\n<P>About S2 Games</P>\r\n<P>The core S2 Games team is an experienced group of developers from diverse backgrounds, including film, fine art, computer science, and business.

The triple-A title, which is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed Savage: The Battle for Newerth, will be available in the Fall of 2006 at a price of $29.99.</p><p>S2 Games is planning to demonstrate how an independent game developer/publisher can create a triple-A title at a fraction of the budget of some comparative titles and be able to pass much of that savings on to the consumer.  The development team at S2 will also have the luxury of working within their own timeline and not having to rush to meet publisher/distribution deadlines, ultimately creating the game they want to create.  Additionally, S2’s unique publishing methods will enable it to publish Savage 2: A Tortured Soul at a much lower price point than comparative titles as they will not have to share revenues with retailers or traditional publishing networks.  S2 is anticipating that its success will open many doors for other Indie teams to focus on quality of product combined with creative marketing in order to achieve the same results.  At the end of the day, S2 Games will have a game where the “hype” is only centered on the actual gameplay.</p><p>“If the game was sold through retail stores, we would be forced to set a higher price point like the other triple-A titles out there,” said Marc DeForest, co-founder and lead designer, S2 Games.  “By circumventing traditional publishing methods, we\'re able to pass the savings directly on to the consumer as well as have much greater artistic license with our game.”</p><p>For more information on Savage 2: A Tortured Soul, please visit http://savage2.s2games.com.</p><p>About S2 Games</p><p>The core S2 Games team is an experienced group of developers from diverse backgrounds, including film, fine art, computer science and business.

Although racing provides a temporary escape from an unhappy home and the superficial world around him, it has also made Sean unpopular with the local authorities. To avoid jail time, Sean is sent to live with his gruff, estranged father, a career military-man stationed in Tokyo.</P>\r\n<P>Now officially a gaijin (outsider), Sean feels even more shut out in a land of foreign customs and codes of honor. But it doesn\'t take long for him to find some action when a fellow American buddy, Twinkie (Bow Wow), introduces him to the underground world of drift racing. Sean\'s simple drag racing gets replaced by a rubber-burning, automotive art form -- with an exhilarating balance of speeding and gliding through a heart-stopping course of hairpin turns and switchbacks.</P>\r\n<P>On his first time out drifting, Sean unknowingly takes on D.K., the \"Drift King,\" a local champ with ties to the Japanese crime machine Yakuza. Sean\'s loss comes at a high price tag when he\'s forced to work off the debt under the thumb of ex-pat Han (Kang). Han soon welcomes Sean into this family of misfits and introduces him to the real principles of drifting. But when Sean falls for D.K.\'s girlfriend, Neela (newcomer Kelley), an explosive series of events is set into motion, climaxing with an ultimate high stakes face off.</P>\r\n<P>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is directed by Justin Lin (Better Luck Tomorrow, Annapolis) and written by Chris Morgan (Cellular), Kario Salem (The Score) and Alfredo Botello.

April 11, 2006.</STRONG> -- Software publisher Strategy First Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Silverstar Holdings, Ltd. (Nasdaq: SSTR), and Akella, a major game publisher and developer based in Russia, are pleased to announce the signing of a cooperative deal for the development and worldwide publication of Disciples III: Renaissance, the next game in Strategy First’s famous Disciples franchise.</P>\r\n<P>“It is a great pleasure to be working on this project with Akella and .dat. The team brings immense talent on the table and both Akella and .dat have everything it takes to give this project the world-class polish we wanted for the Disciples franchise.”, said Richard Therrien, VP Product Developments for Strategy First inc. </P>\r\n<P>“We’re glad to work in cooperation with Strategy First. We have gathered unique and talented developers and game-artists to work on the project. Akella and .dat intend to create the most exciting game in the series - keeping the basis of Disciples and Disciples II we will introduce new features in order to provide gamers with more interesting gameplay and realistic graphics”, says Dmitry Arkhipov, VP of development of Akella.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>About Disciples III: Renaissance</STRONG><BR>Disciples III: Renaissance is the sequel to Disciples II: Dark Prophecy; the award winning Heroic Fantasy Strategy/Role Playing game. The player takes on the role of the Lord of one of the fantastic races of Nevendaar in their enduring struggle to establish the reign of their respective god over the world. Ripe with surprises and turn-arounds, the story of the world of Nevendaar is played on a somber backdrop and shows a unique as well as stunning style that has players asking for more.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Development:<BR></STRONG>Started in the summer of 2005, the development of Disciples III has been undertaken by Akella, a large Russian developer and publisher in close collaboration with Strategy First Inc. and .Dat Company, a Russian developer and partner of Akella, </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Innovations:<BR></STRONG>Advances in game play and the addition of new elements make Disciples III richer and more interesting. The visual design follows the ominous style of the Disciples world, but now all of the game environments and individual units are in stunning real-time 3D.</P>\r\n<P>Disciples III uses .dat’s in-house Virtual Dream engine, which supports all modern 3D technologies, and will initially feature 3 playable races: The Empire, The Legions of the Damned, and the Noble Elves, each with its unique Unit styles and city representation that will allow city sieges, and ending with a battle for the main fortress.</P>\r\n<P>The combat system will be significantly improved with the addition of new elements. Though it remains turn-based, units will move on the battlefield using an improved initiative timer-based system and more advanced interactions between statistical elements that will vary the time of attacks and the order that units take in battle.</P>\r\n<P>At the strategic level, unit turns will also be affected with an initiative factor that will dictate turns at the unit level and not at the Race level. This means increased fluidity in multiplayer and less downtime even in single player.</P>\r\n<P>And there is another new element. In Disciples II, players could use magic only on the Strategic Isometric Map. Disciples III allows a Lord to also use spells on the battlefield. A spell utilizes mana (magic energy) acquired from controlled sources and spell cards that can be bought or found.</P>\r\n<P>As in previous Disciples games, troops receive experience in battle and upon leveling, become more powerful and effective in a way that is dictated by the structure branch selected by the player. Leaders get improved abilities and the player can assign stat bonuses to their liking. An RPG-style system will be implemented for the character advancement screen. Included will be inventory, expanded stats and abilities, as well as a character model that will visually reflect worn armor and equipped weapons and artifacts.</P>\r\n<P><BR><STRONG>About .dat<BR></STRONG>.dat is a Moscow company founded by a talented group who, for many years, worked at Akella and took a major part in the development of Sea Dogs, Pirates of the Caribbean, and other games.

Featuring physics driven animations made only possible by the power of the PLAYSTATION®3, gamers will have a unique experience every time they pick up the controller since no two tricks will ever be the same.

 ('4725','Bethesda Softworks Announces Its Return to First-Person Shooters with Rogue Warrior™','Tactical Shooter for Xbox 360™, PLAYSTATION®3, and Windows Coming in 2007','<P>October 27, 2006 (Rockville, MD) - Bethesda Softworks®, a ZeniMax Media company, today announced its plans to publish Rogue Warrior™, an authentic, tactical first-person shooter based on the best-selling book series by Richard (Dick) Marcinko, former U.S. Navy SEAL and founder of both SEAL Team Six and Red Cell. Rogue Warrior is being developed for the Xbox 360™ videogame and entertainment system from Microsoft, the PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system, and Windows by Zombie Studios in conjunction with Bethesda Softworks.&nbsp; Rogue Warrior is scheduled for a fall 2007 release.</P>\r\n<P>“We are very excited to be working on Rogue Warrior, which allows us the chance to bring Bethesda’s creative vision and development expertise to this brand,” said Vlatko Andonov, president of Bethesda Softworks. “This game marks our return to shooters since our highly successful Terminator series, and we hope to offer fans a true next-generation gameplay experience.”</P>\r\n<P>Rogue Warrior is a story-driven shooter that provides team-based tactical combat set in massive, contiguous levels using Unreal 3 streaming technology. Central to the game’s single and multiplayer experience is the idea of a freeform battlefield, where players are given the freedom to choose how to complete a given objective, allowing for creativity and surprises, rather than heavily scripted events and tightly contained spaces traditionally used in this genre.</P>\r\n<P>An advanced AI system allows NPCs to react and fight realistically, see and hear others, and respond as a team. Rogue Warrior offers a new take on the multiplayer experience, with 10 gameplay modes and a system whereby maps are created using tiles that are selected by each team. Rogue Warrior’s tiling system allows users to experience over 200 maps in both day and nighttime settings. In addition, the campaign features solo and on-the-fly cooperative play for up to four players, where anyone can join or leave an existing campaign game at any time without having to go to menus or save progress.</P>\r\n<P>“Rogue Warrior is the game we’ve been waiting to make for years,” said Mark Long, lead producer at Zombie Studios.&nbsp; “We’re using terrific technology in a way that’s different from other games - we have a unique HUD and control system for your teammates, on-the-fly co-op play, and we’ve really focused our efforts on making multiplayer more fun and challenging by giving you lots of modes and hundreds of maps you can see and play. We’re thrilled to be working with Bethesda on this new initiative using a brand we know and love.”</P>\r\n<P>In Rogue Warrior, you play Dick Marcinko, leader of an elite SEAL unit trapped behind enemy lines in North Korea on a covert mission to assess the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. When war breaks out between North and South Korea, you must try to lead your team back into South Korea while greatly outnumbered and with no support and limited resupply. Your journey will take you through a variety of never-before-seen environments inside of North Korea, including submarine pens, shipbreaker yards, prison camps, and more.</P>\r\n<P>A 30-year veteran with the U.S. Navy, Dick Marcinko served in both the Underwater Demolitions Team and Navy SEAL programs, was a military attache in Cambodia, and conceived, founded, and commanded SEAL Team Six, the U.S. Navy’s first counterterrorism unit. He later created and ran Red Cell, a unit created to test the Navy\'s anti-terrorist capabilities for highly-secured bases, nuclear submarines, ships, and other purported “secure areas”, including Air Force One. Dick’s experiences as a Navy SEAL were captured in his New York Times best-selling autobiography, Rogue Warrior, and his Rogue Warrior fiction series.</P>\r\n<P>“I think this game has a lot going for it and I’m very excited to be a part of it,” said Marcinko. “You have input from my SEALs and me on everything from animations to equipment to artificial intelligence to tactics to ensure accuracy of the gameplay, plus a story that has lots of relevance with the current events in North Korea, and the expertise in making great games that comes from Bethesda and Zombie…I think it’s going to take names like only a SEAL can.”</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>About Bethesda Softworks®</STRONG></P>\r\n<P>Headquartered in Rockville, MD, Bethesda Softworks LLC, a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media Inc., is a premier developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software and has produced numerous award-winning titles, most recently with The Elder Scrolls® IV: Oblivion™ and the 2002 PC and Xbox® Game of the Year and RPG of the Year, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrrowind®.&nbsp; Among Bethesda’s more popular franchises are The Elder Scrolls® series and Fallout®, as well as its licensed properties like the recently released Star Trek® and Pirates of the Caribbean games.

 ('5294','Combat Mission: Shock Force Screenshots','Scheduled for Q2-2007 not yet rated','<P>Combat Mission: Shock Force is poised to become the new gold standard for computer wargames and military simulations. With over three years of intensive ground-up development, Combat Mission: Shock Force is ready to succeed Battlefront\'s previous series of top rated, award winning WW2 tactical simulations; Combat Mission Beyond Overlord, Barbarossa to Berlin, and Afrika Korps.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>[SETTING]</STRONG><BR>At it\'s core, Combat Mission: Shock Force is a military simulation depicting a hypothetical near-future conflict in Syria following a fundamentalist coup d\'état. As in Afghanistan 2001, the radical new government\'s refusal to shut down major terrorist organizations and its\' regional destabilizing effect, compel NATO Coalition forces into action. <BR>The initial release of Combat Mission: Shock Force focuses on the actions of the US Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) as they fight against Syrian Army Infantry, Mechanized and Armored units. Combat Mission: Shock Force also features Unconventional Threat forces such as terrorists, spies, suicide bombers, IED\'s and other deadly tools employed in the asymmetric warfare of the modern day. <BR>Along with the standard Red vs. Blue engagements typified in most wargames, Combat Mission: Shock Force will also allow players to fight Red vs. Red (Syria vs. Syria) and Blue vs. Blue (NATO vs. NATO) battles as well.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>[ENVIRONMENT]</STRONG><BR>Since Combat Mission: Shock Force models combat set in Syria, a nation rich in diverse geography, the terrain types range from flat expanses of desert to vast wooded and mountainous regions and from small villages and towns all the way up to and including dense urban centers. Gamers familiar with the earlier Combat Mission games will be thrilled with the new 1 meter by 1 meter terrain mesh that allows for stunningly realistic maps. Dynamic lighting, deformable terrain, new \'flavor objects\' and graphic special effects only help to further accentuate and intensify the playable environments. <BR>Of course this new High Fidelity terrain modeling also extends into the realm of structures. Combat Mission: Shock Force features buildings with distinct window and door placement and interaction, variable roof styles, balconies, foundation sizes and heights. Buildings range from simple single story shops to soaring 8 story high housing and office complexes. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>[STRUCTURE]</STRONG><BR>Combat Mission: Shock Force features a completely new experience for players in the form of a highly story-driven, semi-dynamic campaign from the US perspective. Each battle includes a detailed Mission Briefing outlining specific objectives, ranging from traditional \"hold this spot\" type battles to engagements where maintaining force cohesion or inflicting casualties is the goal. <BR>In addition to the playable story based campaign are many stand alone battles depicting various types of firefights and situations facing the US and Syrian forces. Playable from either side (or both in Multiplayer mode), these single battles will cover a wide range of battle types, forces and environments. <BR>The dynamic style of play inherent in Combat Mission: Shock Force\'s new game engine allows, for the first time, unique objectives for each side in a given battle, allowing each side to fight to fulfill its own goals rather than a single set common to both. This introduces a new challenge of having to guess and anticipate what the enemy is trying to achieve instead of knowing for sure what the other side is up to. <BR>For those that prefer quick pick-up-and-play games, Combat Mission: Shock Force also includes the fan favorite Quick Battle option, now with more customizable options than ever. Those with a penchant for design can dive right in to the all new designed and expanded Game Editor to create their own battles.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>[REALITY MODELING]</STRONG><BR>Like in earlier Combat Mission games, games, Shock Force puts players in control of teams, squads, individual vehicles, and support assets organized according to meticulously researched real life TO&amp;E (Tables of Organization and Equipment). New to Combat Mission: Shock Force is that each soldier is now modeled individually, including independent spotting and combat/weapon capabilities. <BR>Vehicles are also simulated in greater fidelity in Combat Mission: Shock Force than what was possible before. This allows not just for exponentially greater data modeling, but also better visuals as the 3D models now sport between 10 and 30 times more polygons as in earlier titles. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>[GAMEPLAY]</STRONG><BR>To accurately simulate the often frantic and rapid pace of modern combat, the Combat Mission: Shock Force game engine was designed and programmed from the start to be RealTime. Experience Combat Mission like never before as you order your units while the battle rages on around you.<BR>Knowing that RealTime play is not for everyone, Combat Mission: Shock Force also offers the exact same ground breaking WeGo hybrid turn based system that propelled the original Combat Mission games to an unprecedented three Wargame of the Year Awards from PC Gamer magazine.<BR>Play the game as you want, in RealTime mode or in the traditional WeGo turn based style. Battle against the AI or another Human player via TCP/IP, PBEM (Play By Email), or Hotseat.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>[INSERT KITCHEN SINK HERE]</STRONG><BR>There are so many powerful features awaiting you in Combat Mission: Shock Force that it\'s impossible to list but a few of them. Experience the unique Relative Spotting system that reduces the unrealistic targeting problems found in most games (aka Borg Spotting), call in highly realistic air and artillery support, encounter extensive vehicle damage modeling, wield a full array of modern ATGMs, utilize up-to-date \"up armor\" modifications to US vehicles, control dozens of extremely detailed vehicle types with fully articulated suspension systems, command your troops using realistic portrayals of C4ISR communication systems, and so much more.<BR><BR>Combat Mission: Shock Force is scheduled for a release in Q2-2007, and will be sold via digital delivery and mail delivery directly from <A href=\"http://www.battlefront.com\">www.battlefront.com</A> as well as available in stores through our partner, Paradox Interactive.</P>','With over three years of intensive ground-up development, Combat Mission: Shock Force is ready to succeed Battlefront\'s previous series of top rated, award winning WW2 tactical simulations; Combat Mission Beyond Overlord, Barbarossa to Berlin, and Afrika Korps.','2007-03-07','67');

 ('5769','SIMCITY SERIES MAKES HIGHLY- ANTICIPATED HOMECOMING AS EA ANNOUNCES SIMCITY SOCIETIES FOR THE PC','Create your own kinds of cities with SimCity Societies','<p><b>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. — June 12, 2007</b> — The return of one of PC gaming’s most popular series – SimCity™ – is here! Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS) announced today that SimCity™ Societies™ is in development and is scheduled to hit retail stores this holiday season. Featuring an all-new, revolutionary feature set, SimCity Societies allows players to construct not only the cities they desire, but create their cultures, societal behaviors and environments as well. Build an artistic city, haunted town, green city, spiritual community or most any society you want! Using the accessible, innovative and versatile city-builder, players can create their own kind of city in SimCity Societies.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>“SimCity Societies allows players to create a variety of cities with the unique societies they desire,” said Vice President and Studio Head of The Sims Division, Rod Humble. “There is such a variety of cities to build from in SimCity Societies – and they’re all such a blast to play. Sometimes I build an aggressive police state where stragglers are dragged off to re-conditioning centers and emerge ready for work. Other times, I build a green community in the tropics, where the citizens grow their own food and have a small environmental footprint. With so many options to choose from, SimCity Societies is the most flexible city building game ever!”</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Players start by choosing from a variety of more than 350 building types, each of which allows them to combine, connect and re-arrange structures freely. Players can challenge authority and experiment with what happens when citizens flagrantly disobey power in an unruly Orwellian society. Or if players are feeling happy, they can build a Fun City filled with Ferris Wheels, Gingerbread Houses and Chocolate Factories! Inspiration can come from a wide range of architectural periods ranging from the realistic to the fanciful; from the industrial age to futuristic designs, with each structure reflecting its name and nature, many offering a click-on action for fans to play upon! As each city evolves, players will be able to unlock new buildings that can help advance – or regress – their society.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>SimCity Societies introduces an all-new, revolutionary feature set for players to combine buildings that will produce or consume new kinds of resources called “social energies.” How you mix and match these resources – industry, wealth, obedience, knowledge, devotion, or creativity—determines the social energy of your city. Will your city be happy and creative, spiritual and knowledgeable, will it be wealthy and powerful or obedient and fearful? Its fate is in your hands!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will players be able to build from any or all energies, but the cities will look and behave differently depending on the energy combinations the player makes. From futuristic metropolises and fantastical haunted cities to obedient Orwellian states and devout contemplative towns – what to combine and connect is up to the creator.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The SimCity franchise is one of the most popular PC gaming franchises in history, having sold more than 17 million games worldwide to date since the SimCity launch in 1989. Subsequent base game releases include SimCity 2000™ (1993), SimCity 3000™ (1999) and SimCity 4™ (2003).</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>SimCity Societies is being published by Electronic Arts and developed by Tilted Mill Entertainment.

Based on Games Workshop’s wildly successful Warhammer® tabletop fantasy war game, WAR features next generation Realm vs. Realm (RvR) game play that will immerse players in a world of perpetual conflict. Players can choose to join the Armies of Order (Dwarfs, High Elves, and human subjects of the Empire) or the sinister Armies of Destruction (Orcs and Goblins, Dark Elves, and human worshippers of Chaos) with the ultimate goal in RvR combat being the sacking of an enemy’s Capital City. To do this, an army must invade and take control of the opposition’s homeland. Deciding battles take place on objective-based Battlefields and in instanced Scenarios - point-balanced battles that make use of NPC mercenaries known as Dogs of War. For the first time, WAR’s RvR system integrates both Player vs. Player (PvP) combat and Player vs. Environment (PvE) content on the same map. This means that every aspect of the game, including PvE missions and innovative Public Quests™, is geared towards the greater war in some important way. Drawing from a quarter century of highly detailed source material, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning will bring Games Workshop’s fantasy world to life in a way that will allow players to create characters destined for great deeds and glory on the field of battle.

Durant, 18, is the second youngest athlete – and just the fourth teenager – ever featured on an EA SPORTS game cover.</P>\r\n<P>The Longhorns’ star, who likely will be the first or second pick in the NBA Draft later this week, joins an exclusive list of world-class teenagers to be selected to the cover of an EA SPORTS videogame franchise, taking his place alongside Freddy Adu (FIFA Soccer 06) of the MLS Real Salt Lake, Carmelo Anthony (NCAA March Madness 04) of the NBA Denver Nuggets and Wayne Rooney (FIFA 06 in United Kingdom) of Manchester United.</P>\r\n<P>EA SPORTS Teenage Cover Athletes:<BR>NO. &nbsp;&nbsp;PLAYER &nbsp;&nbsp;AGE &nbsp;&nbsp;EA SPORTS FRANCHISE<BR>1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Freddy Adu &nbsp;&nbsp;16 years &nbsp;&nbsp;FIFA Soccer 06 (North America)<BR>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin Durant &nbsp;&nbsp;18 years &nbsp;&nbsp;NCAA March Madness 08<BR>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Carmelo Anthony &nbsp;&nbsp;19 years &nbsp;&nbsp;NCAA March Madness 04<BR>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wayne Rooney &nbsp;&nbsp;19 years &nbsp;&nbsp;FIFA 06 (Europe)</P>\r\n<P>Durant’s appearance on the cover of NCAA March Madness 08 also marks the first time that alums from the same school have been on EA SPORTS covers at the same time. Former University of Texas quarterback Vince Young is the Madden™ NFL 08 cover athlete. Durant and Young are in the company of an all-star group of EA SPORTS cover stars that this year includes Ronaldinho (FC Barcelona, FIFA Soccer 08), Gilbert Arenas (Washington Wizards, NBA LIVE 08), Jared Zabransky (Boise State University, NCAA Football 08) and Tony Stewart on NASCAR 08.</P>\r\n<P>Durant is the fourth former Texas athlete to appear on an EA SPORTS cover.

It’s like a dream come true.”</P>\r\n<P>EA SPORTS’ relationship with Durant, negotiated through Goodwin Sports Management, includes appearing on the cover of NCAA March Madness 08, participating in the development of EA’s basketball games and promotional appearances.

In addition to the Naismith (presented by AT&amp;T and the Atlanta Tip-off Club) and Wooden (presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club) honors, he earned the Oscar Robertson Trophy from the U.S. Basketball Writers Association, the Adolph Rupp Trophy from the Commonwealth Athletic Club of Kentucky, and was named Player of the Year by the Associated Press, the National Association of Basketball Coaches and CBS/Chevrolet. The multi-talented swingman was the only unanimous choice to the Associated Press All-America first team, and the first freshman to garner Big 12 Conference Player of the Year accolades. He led the league in scoring (25.8 ppg), rebounding (11.1 rpg) and blocked shots (67). Durant was the only player in the country to rank in the Top 10 nationally in both scoring (fourth) and rebounding (fourth), and he finished second nationally in double-doubles (20). He led the Longhorns to a 25-10 record (12-4 Big 12) and a No. 11 ranking in the final AP poll. Durant set the school and Big 12 single-season scoring mark (903 points) and became just the second freshman in NCAA history to top the 900-point plateau (965 by Chris Jackson, LSU, 1988-89).</P>\r\n<P>NCAA March Madness 08 is in development at EA Canada in Burnaby, B.C., and will be available for the PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system, the PlayStation®2 and the Xbox 360™ video game and entertainment system from Microsoft.

After saving earth from invasion by Red Falcon, Bill Rizer and Lance Bean are confronted with a new extraterrestrial menace: the terrifying Black Viper. Joined by hard-boiled mercenaries Mad Dog and Scorpion, the warriors must once again wage war against an entire army of invaders. </P>\r\n<P>Refining the 2D side-scrolling genre the series established 20 years ago, Contra 4 delivers pure action at a fever pitch as players jump, shoot, and dodge oncoming hazards. Utilizing a new dual screen presentation, the action spans both screens of the Nintendo DS, giving players the opportunity to battle across expansive environments in which death can come from any direction. The use of both screens for the game’s core action also allows for massive boss battles as players try to seek and destroy the weak points of sky-high enemies. A first for the series, Contra 4 introduces a grappling hook accessory that lets players grab onto elements of the environment directly above them. Whether using it to avoid oncoming dangers or attack from a strategic vantage point, the grappling hook allows for new combat situations and dramatic set pieces that underscore the game’s adrenaline-soaked pedigree. </P>\r\n<P>Continuing the multiplayer tradition of previous games in the series, Contra 4 lets two players battle together against Black Viper’s army of vile alien forces and reclaim Earth for mankind. </P>\r\n<P>Developed by WayForward Technologies, Contra 4 is planned for release on the Nintendo DS in 2007.

The Beowulf(TM) video game is being developed by the award-winning team that created the original Tom Clancy\'s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter® in Ubisoft\'s Tiwak studio. The Beowulf(TM) video game is scheduled for worldwide release in conjunction with the movie\'s opening in November 2007.</P>\r\n<P>The Beowulf(TM) video game takes players deep into groundbreaking director Robert Zemeckis\' vision of the classic saga, Beowulf. Gamers live the life of Beowulf, the legendary Norse warrior with the strength of 30 men who is torn between the nobility and brutality within him. Arrogant, self-serving and lustful for gold and glory, Beowulf will journey to Denmark to destroy a bloodthirsty beast wreaking havoc on a frigid land. But evil persists, and Beowulf succumbs to its lure of even greater fame, quietly maneuvering to claim the Danish throne. As King, Beowulf must face the consequences of ambition, even as war descends on the realm. As Beowulf, players lead their men, called thanes, into battle, slay the Titans of a dying age and crush the enemies that threaten to annihilate both their kingdom and people. Only then, when Beowulf looks Destiny in the eye, will he know what kind of hero he has truly become.</P>\r\n<P>\"Ubisoft, Paramount Pictures and Shangri-La Entertainment have been working extremely close in developing Beowulf,” said Gilles Matouba, creative director at Ubisoft. \"From the very beginning, we have had an unprecedented level of access to information and assets from the movie. This access, coupled with the creative and technological abilities of our team, has allowed us to capture aspects of the film and translate them perfectly into compelling gameplay elements such as the visceral hand-to-hand combat, dynamic swordplay and amazing visuals, while giving us the creative liberty to go even further by creating exclusive content for the game that is unexplored by the film and even the classic tale.”</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Key features</STRONG>:</P>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">\r\n<P>•&nbsp;Delve even deeper into the adventure as gamers will play through 30 years of the Beowulf story not seen in the movie to experience more of Beowulf\'s life and mold their own legacy. <BR>•&nbsp;The mystical world of Beowulf comes to life in stunning fashion.

Carnal upgrades include less daze after use and prolonged use of Carnal Fury. But if used too much, there will be grave consequences.<BR>•&nbsp;Dynamic combat system including combos, parries and increasing skills as the player progresses.<BR>•&nbsp;Grab ability allows Beowulf to hold on to walls or climb, as well as fight up close with visceral hand-to-hand combat against enemies and giant monsters. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n<P>\"The talented creators at Ubisoft are transforming our vision of the film into an interactive experience that extends the epic adventure far beyond its classic storyline,” said Robert Zemeckis, director of Beowulf. \"We\'ve been thoroughly impressed with what we\'ve seen from the game makers and are confident that gamers will find it to be an immersive and entertaining experience that goes far beyond the traditional movie-licensed game.”</P>\r\n<P>Groundbreaking director Robert Zemeckis offers a vision of the Beowulf saga that has never been told before. In a time of heroes, the mighty warrior Beowulf slays the demon Grendel and incurs the wrath of its monstrous, yet seductive, mother in a conflict that transforms a king into a legend. Beowulf stars Ray Winstone in the title role and Anthony Hopkins as the corrupt King Hrothgar, as well as John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, Crispin Glover, Alison Lohman and Angelina Jolie as Grendel\'s mother.

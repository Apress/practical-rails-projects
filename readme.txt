Included in this zip file are the source files for all of the projects in the book.

A seperate file containing only the resources (minus the source code from the book is also available) and I highly encourage you to use those and work from the book by hand - otherwise you won't learn as much.

Also be sure to visit www.railsprojects.com to talk with other readers of the book, share solutions to the exercise problems and be alerted to any changes to these source files.

Thanks

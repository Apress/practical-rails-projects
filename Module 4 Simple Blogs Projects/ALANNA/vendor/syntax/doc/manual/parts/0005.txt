Colorizing code has already been touched on briefly in the Introduction chapter (under "Quick Start"). To review, the process is a mere three steps:

# Require the class for the type of the output you want (currently, only HTML is supported).
# Obtain an instance of the convertor, for the syntax you wish to convert.
# Call @#convert@ on that convertor, passing in the text you want to convert. The return value is the HTML representation of the colorized text.

For example:

{{{lang=ruby,number=true,caption=Colorizing a Ruby script
# Step 1: require the HTML convertor
require 'syntax/convertor/html'

# Step 2: get an instance of the HTML convertor for the Ruby syntax
convertor = Syntax::Convertor::HTML.for_syntax "ruby"

# Step 3: convert the text to HTML
puts convertor.convert( File.read( "program.rb" ) )
}}}

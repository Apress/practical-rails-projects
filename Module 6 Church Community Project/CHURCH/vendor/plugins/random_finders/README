RandomFinders
=============

Allows quick and easy fetching of random records, or records in random order.

Simply pass the :random to the order in any finder method.

Examples
========

Find a random article
  Article.find(:first, :order => :random)
  
Randomize photos
  Photo.find(:all, :order => :random)
  

Caveat
======

This will not treat you nicely with large datasets.
